## Timeline Summary

```
Day 1-2:   Foundation (Next.js setup, Supabase, deploy skeleton)
Day 3-5:   Landing page (4 variants, A/B testing, responsive design)
Day 6:     Database schema & setup
Day 7-9:   Assessment form (questions, multi-step flow, submission)
Day 10-11: Results generation & display (AI profile, shareable page)
Day 12-13: Analytics integration (PostHog, scroll tracking, funnel)
Day 14:    Polish, QA, launch (LinkedIn ads, monitoring)
Day 15+:   Monitor & analyze (daily checks, session replays, Week 1 analysis)
```

**Critical Path:** Foundation → Landing → Assessment → Results → Analytics → Launch

Each phase builds on the previous, so delays compound. The 2-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused full-time work.
