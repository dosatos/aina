## Context

**Why this change:** Build a Phase 0 validation MVP to test language-market fit before investing 8+ weeks in full product development. The goal is to validate whether engineers will (1) complete a 15-20 minute behavioral assessment and (2) find the results insightful enough to share.

**Current State:**
- 100% documentation, zero implementation code
- Expert-reviewed landing page content exists in `docs/marketing/`
- Template 3 (System Designer for Engineers) ready with 4 A/B test variants
- Planned tech stack: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Supabase + Vercel

**Success Criteria:**
- 50%+ completion rate = language-market fit validated
- 2+ min time on page
- 60%+ scroll to "How It Works"
- Deploy and validate within 2 weeks (aggressive timeline)

**User Decisions:**
- CTA leads to built-in assessment form (not external Google Form)
- Focus on Template 3 (Engineers) with 4 variants
- 2-week timeline from project init to live with LinkedIn ads
