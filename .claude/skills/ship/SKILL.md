# Ship — 24-Hour Launch Checklist

The goal is live, not perfect. Everything on this list is either required to take a payment or required to not embarrass yourself. That's it.

## The Philosophy

Shipping is a skill. Most founders delay because they're optimizing things that don't matter yet. The checklist is ruthlessly minimal: if it won't cause a sale to fail or a customer to leave immediately, it's not on the list.

## Process

1. **Read `project/product-brief.md`** for: offer type, primary CTA, price point, ICP.
2. **Read `project/plan.md`** for current state — what's built, what's done.
3. **Generate a checklist** specific to the offer type (waitlist / free trial / direct purchase / demo booking).
4. **Sequence by dependency** — the order matters. Don't pay for ads before the page is live.

## Output Format

**Launch type**: [Waitlist / Smoke test / Paid product / Free trial / Demo booking]

**The 24-hour checklist** (in order):

**Hour 1–4: The essential surfaces**
- [ ] [Task] — [Why it matters / what happens if skipped]
- [ ] [Task]
- [ ] [Task]

**Hour 5–12: The payment/conversion path**
- [ ] [Task]
- [ ] [Task]

**Hour 13–20: The "don't embarrass yourself" checks**
- [ ] [Task] — [e.g., test the full flow end-to-end from a fresh browser]
- [ ] [Task]

**Hour 21–24: The first traffic**
- [ ] [Where to post first — specific: subreddit name, community, Slack group, not "social media"]
- [ ] [Second place]
- [ ] [What to say — give the actual post/DM template, 3–5 sentences]

**What's NOT on the list** (skip these for launch):
- [Thing founders waste time on] — do this after first 5 customers
- [Another common delay] — irrelevant until you have traction

**The "ship it" threshold**: You are live when someone who doesn't know you can find the page, understand the offer, and complete the CTA without your help. Test this with one real person before calling it launched.

**First metric to watch**: [One number — the thing you'll look at in 24 hours to know if the launch worked]
