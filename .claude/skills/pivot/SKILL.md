# Pivot — Change Direction Without Starting Over

A pivot is not a restart. You change one variable: either the Audience or the Offer. Not both. Not the whole product.

## The Two Pivot Types

**Audience pivot**: Same product, different ICP.
- The thing you built solves the problem — but for a different person than you targeted
- Look for: unexpected users, industries using it differently than you expected, referrals from people you didn't pitch

**Offer pivot**: Same ICP, different packaging/pricing/entry point.
- The audience is right — but how you're selling it is wrong
- Look for: people who want the outcome but won't pay the price, people who buy a watered-down version, people who ask "can I just get X without Y"

## What a Pivot Is NOT

- Changing everything and rebuilding from scratch (that's quitting)
- Adding more features to fix a conversion problem (that's procrastinating)
- Running more ads to a broken funnel (that's expensive delusion)

## Process

1. **Read `project/plan.md`** to understand what's been tried and what signal was gathered.
2. **Diagnose the failure**: Was it no traffic? Traffic with no conversion? Conversion with no retention?
3. **Identify which variable broke**: Audience, Offer, or Channel (channel is the cheapest fix — try that first before pivoting ICP or offer).
4. **Generate pivot options** — 2 options maximum. One audience pivot, one offer pivot. Pick the one with higher signal.

## Output Format

**What the data says**: [1–2 sentences on what actually happened — clicks, signups, conversations, sales. Be specific about the numbers.]

**The break point**: [Where in the funnel it broke — traffic / conversion / retention]

**Recommended pivot type**: Audience or Offer (not both)

**Option A — [Audience/Offer] pivot**:
- What changes: [Specific — new ICP or new packaging]
- What stays the same: [What you don't rebuild]
- How to test it in < 7 days: [Specific test]
- Signal threshold: [What "working" looks like]

**Option B** (alternative if A doesn't resonate):
- Same structure

**The move**: Pick A or B. One sentence on why.

**What to kill**: If you pivot, what stops today. Name it.
