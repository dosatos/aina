# LP Structure Builder

Build a complete landing page structure from the product brief. Output is a ready-to-hand-to-a-designer/developer spec — not a wireframe description, but the actual copy and content.

## Process

1. **Read `project/product-brief.md`** to extract: ICP, core pain, trigger moment, unique mechanism, offer, risk reversal, primary CTA, price point, objections.
2. **Build each section** in order (LP anatomy sequence).
3. **Write real copy** — not placeholder text, not "[Your headline here]". Actual words.

## Output Format

### Headline Section
**Variant A**: [Pain-focused — names the specific painful situation]
**Variant B**: [Outcome-focused — names the specific result they'll get]
**Variant C**: [Mechanism-focused — names why your approach is different]
Recommendation: [Which one to test first and why — one sentence]

### Pain Section (3–5 bullets)
Write in second person ("You're...") or first person ("I used to..."). Name specific moments, not categories.
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]
(Add 4–5 if the brief has enough pain detail)

### Product Section
**Setup line**: [One sentence bridging pain to product — "That's why we built X"]
**Mechanism**: [One paragraph: what makes this approach work when alternatives don't — specific, not generic]
**How it works** (3 steps max):
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
**What to show here**: [Describe what demo/screenshot/video would be most persuasive — be specific about the exact flow to show]

### CTA Section
**Primary CTA button**: [Outcome-oriented text — not "Submit" or "Get Started"]
**Microcopy below button**: [Reduces the #1 objection — e.g., "No credit card. Cancel anytime." or "Free for first 30 days."]
**Supporting line**: [Optional — addresses the #2 objection or adds urgency/social proof]

### Repeat CTA
Same button text appears at bottom of page. Add one line of social proof here if available.

**What to cut**: Name 1–2 things commonly added to LPs that should NOT be on this one (e.g., "Don't add a features comparison table — your ICP isn't in evaluation mode yet").
