# Build in Public Post Generator

Generate 3 post options based on where the project is right now. Follow Pieter Levels' BIP formula: specific numbers + honest context + one actionable takeaway. Not inspirational fluff. Not "day 47 of my journey 🚀".

## The Principle

Build in Public (BIP) works because:
1. It builds trust (you're showing receipts, not claims)
2. It attracts the right people (your struggles are their struggles)
3. It compounds (every post is a search result and a proof point)

Bad BIP: "Feeling grateful for this journey. Keep grinding!"
Good BIP: "Spent $347 on Meta ads. Got 2 signups. CAC is $173. Killing this angle and trying Reddit DMs tomorrow."

## Process

1. **Read `project/product-brief.md` and `project/plan.md`** to understand: what stage (idea/pre-revenue/early-revenue/scaling), recent wins/losses, current metrics.
2. **Identify what's actually happening right now** — not what you wish was happening. BIP is documentary, not aspirational.
3. **Generate 3 post options** based on Levels' 3 types:
   - **Progress share**: Revenue number, user count, or conversion rate + what changed to get there
   - **Failure share**: What didn't work + the specific reason why + what you're doing instead
   - **Lesson share**: The one counterintuitive thing you learned + the proof + the takeaway
4. **Pick the platform**: X/Twitter for devs/builders, LinkedIn for B2B, threads for longer context.

## Output Format

**Post Option 1 — Progress Share**
[280-character post with: specific metric + time period + one insight]

**Post Option 2 — Failure Share**
[280-character post with: what you tried + $ or time spent + why it failed + next move]

**Post Option 3 — Lesson Share**
[280-character post with: the belief you had + what actually happened + the takeaway]

**Recommended platform**: [X / LinkedIn / Threads] because [reason based on ICP]

**Posting cadence**: [How often to share — usually 2-3x/week for BIP, not daily inspiration spam]

## Rules

- Every post must have at least one specific number (not "a lot of users" — "47 users")
- No motivational language ("keep grinding", "trust the process", "stay hungry")
- No fake humility ("not sure if anyone cares but...")
- Lead with the number or the loss, not the context
- If there's no signal yet (no users, no revenue, no tests run), say: "You don't have anything to build in public with yet. Run a smoke test first."
