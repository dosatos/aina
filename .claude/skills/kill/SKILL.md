# Kill — Prove It Will Fail

Your job is to find every reason this idea will not work. Be adversarial. Be specific. If you can't kill it, it's worth testing.

## The Logic

Most ideas die of predictable causes. The goal is to find those causes now, before spending time and money. If an idea survives this interrogation, it's not because it's perfect — it's because the failure modes are survivable or solvable.

This is not pessimism. This is how you avoid wasting 6 months on something that breaks on first contact with reality.

## The Kill Framework

Work through each attack vector. Be specific — "it's competitive" is not a kill. "There are 12 funded competitors with 3-year head starts and the top 3 have > 10k reviews on G2" is a kill.

**Attack vector 1 — Demand**
Does the pain actually exist at the frequency and intensity you assume? Or are you solving a "nice to have" that people tolerate for free?

**Attack vector 2 — Willingness to pay**
Is this audience actually willing to pay for a solution, or do they expect it free? (Consumers are harder to charge than B2B. Some pains are "complain about it" pains, not "pay to fix" pains.)

**Attack vector 3 — Competition**
What's already out there? Why haven't the existing solutions won? If there's no competition, is it because the market doesn't exist — or because you found a gap?

**Attack vector 4 — Distribution**
How do you reach this ICP? If you can't name a specific channel, community, or list where they congregate, you don't have a go-to-market.

**Attack vector 5 — Unit economics**
At realistic pricing and realistic CAC for this channel, does the math work? (Run /math if needed.)

**Attack vector 6 — Founder fit**
Do you have the specific advantage to win here — relationships, domain expertise, distribution? Or are you betting on figuring it out?

## Output Format

For each attack vector: **status** (Survives / Wounded / Dead) + one sentence on why.

**Attack 1 — Demand**: [Survives / Wounded / Dead] — [Why]
**Attack 2 — Willingness to pay**: [Status] — [Why]
**Attack 3 — Competition**: [Status] — [Why]
**Attack 4 — Distribution**: [Status] — [Why]
**Attack 5 — Unit economics**: [Status] — [Why]
**Attack 6 — Founder fit**: [Status] — [Why]

**Verdict**:
- **Kill it**: 2+ vectors are Dead with no clear fix
- **Fix first, then test**: 1–2 vectors are Wounded with a specific fix
- **Test it**: All vectors Survive or Wounded with cheap fixes

**If "Fix first, then test" — the one fix**: [The specific thing to resolve before starting. Not a list.]

**If "Test it" — the 48-hour test**: [What to do this week to find out if you're right]

Don't be diplomatic. If it's a bad idea, say it clearly.
