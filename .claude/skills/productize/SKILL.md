# Productization Skill

Turn repeatable work into a scalable product. Based on Justin Welsh's "build once, sell twice" framework. The goal: replace your time with a deliverable that works without you.

## The Principle

Services trade time for money. Products trade creation time for infinite delivery. A productized service still requires you. A digital product does not.

The productization ladder (from least to most leverage):
1. **Consulting** ($): You do the work. One client at a time. Revenue caps at your hourly rate × hours available.
2. **Template/Guide** ($$): You package the process. They do the work. One-time creation, infinite sales.
3. **Course/Cohort** ($$$): You teach the skill. They learn + do the work. Async or semi-async.
4. **Tool/SaaS** ($$$$): Software does the work. They get the result. Infinite scale, highest margin.

Start one rung up from where you are now. Not three rungs up.

## Process

1. **Identify the repeatable unit**: What have you done 5+ times that people paid for? What's the consistent outcome?
2. **Ask the productization question**: Does this require YOUR time to deliver, or can it deliver without you?
3. **Map to the ladder**: Which rung can you reach in 30 days? (Not the dream state — the realistic next move.)
4. **Determine format and platform**: What form does the product take, and where do you sell it?
5. **Price it**: Use the 10x rule — if consulting is $150/hr × 10 hours = $1,500, the productized version is $150-$300 (10% of consulting price, because they do the work themselves).

## Output Format

**The repeatable unit you've been doing:**
[Specific service or thing you've done 5+ times — e.g., "Built Stripe + Airtable integrations for SaaS founders"]

**Current state:**
[Where you are now on the ladder — e.g., "Consulting: $2k per integration, takes 8-10 hours"]

**Productized version (one rung up):**
[What the product is — e.g., "Template: Stripe-to-Airtable Zapier blueprint with setup doc"]

**Why this rung (not higher):**
[E.g., "You don't have time to build SaaS. You can package what you've already built into a template in 3 days."]

**Format:**
[Notion doc, Figma file, Gumroad PDF, Loom walkthrough, GitHub repo, Airtable base, etc.]

**Where to sell:**
- **Gumroad**: Digital downloads, templates, guides, one-time payments
- **Lemon Squeezy**: Same as Gumroad, better for non-US sellers
- **Stripe Payment Links**: Direct checkout for anything
- **Teachable / Podia**: Courses only
- **Your own site**: If you already have traffic

**Price:**
[$X based on 10x rule or comparable market products]

**The key question:**
Does this product require you to deliver it, or does it deliver without you?
- If it requires you: it's still a service (even if "productized"). Consider templatizing one more layer.
- If it delivers without you: it's a product. Ship it.

**Next step:**
[One concrete action — e.g., "Export the last 3 Zapier setups you built, turn them into a step-by-step Notion doc, list on Gumroad by Friday."]

## Rules

- Don't jump from consulting to SaaS unless you have 6 months of runway and can code. Start with templates or guides.
- Don't create a course as your first product unless you already have an audience. Courses are the hardest to sell cold.
- Pricing: if unsure, start at 10% of what consulting costs. A $3k service becomes a $300 template.
- Don't overcomplicate delivery. Notion + Loom + Gumroad is enough. No custom platforms.
- If they haven't done the thing 5+ times for money, they don't have a productization candidate yet. They have an idea. Send them to validation first.
