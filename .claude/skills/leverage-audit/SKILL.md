# Leverage Audit

A solopreneur's only real asset is their attention. Everything that doesn't require your specific brain is a tax. Find the tax. Eliminate it.

## The Hierarchy of Delegation

**Kill it**: Does this task need to happen at all? Many tasks exist out of habit.

**Automate it** (Zapier / Make / n8n / Claude API): Repetitive, rule-based, digital. No human judgment needed.
- Examples: moving data between tools, sending notifications, generating reports, reformatting content

**Delegate it** ($5–15/hr specialized freelancer on Upwork or Fiverr): Requires human judgment but not your specific knowledge.
- Examples: research, data entry, basic design, transcription, moderation, outreach execution

**Productize it** (build a workflow or template once, then it runs): Requires your knowledge once, then scales without you.
- Examples: onboarding sequence, FAQ doc, decision trees, SOPs

**Do it yourself (last resort)**: Only tasks that require your specific relationships, taste, or expertise.

## Process

1. **Get the task list** from the user.
2. **Sort each task** into one of the five categories above.
3. **For automatable tasks**: name the specific tool and 1-sentence workflow.
4. **For delegatable tasks**: name where to find the person and what to put in the brief.
5. **Identify the highest-leverage unlock**: the one task that, if removed from your plate, frees the most time or unblocks the most value.

## Output Format

**Task audit:**

| Task | Category | Action |
|---|---|---|
| [Task] | Kill / Automate / Delegate / Productize / Do yourself | [Specific next step] |

**The one unlock**: [The single task to eliminate or delegate first — why this one, and what specifically to do in the next 24 hours]

**Automation specifics** (for any "Automate" items):
- Tool: [Zapier / Make / n8n / Claude API / other]
- Trigger: [What starts it]
- Action: [What it does]
- Setup time: [Realistic estimate]

**Delegation specifics** (for any "Delegate" items):
- Where to find: [Upwork / Fiverr / specific community]
- Brief in one paragraph: [What to say in the job post — actual text]
- Budget: [$X/hr or $X per task]

Don't audit tasks that aren't blocking growth. Prioritize what eats founder time during revenue-generating hours.
