## LP Anatomy

A landing page has four jobs in order. If one fails, the rest don't matter.

### 1. Headline
**Job**: Stop the right person and make them feel seen in under 5 seconds.

**Good**: Speaks the pain or the outcome in the customer's words. Specific. No company name above it.
- "Stop losing leads because your follow-up was 3 days late"
- "The invoicing tool freelancers actually finish setting up"

**Bad**: Company-centric, vague, or feature-forward.
- "Revolutionizing the way teams collaborate"
- "Welcome to [Product]"
- "The #1 solution for enterprise workflow optimization"

### 2. Pain Section
**Job**: Make the visitor feel understood before selling anything.

**Good**: 3–5 bullets that name specific painful moments (not categories of pain). Written in first person or second person. Uses language from real customer interviews/reviews.
- "You quoted the project, they said yes, and now you're chasing the invoice for 45 days"
- "Your team is on Slack, Notion, Asana, and email — and nothing is in the same place"

**Bad**: Generic, feature-adjacent, or company-framed.
- "Inefficient workflows cost businesses millions"
- "Lack of visibility into team performance"

### 3. Product / Mechanism Section
**Job**: Show how you solve the pain differently. Demo > screenshot > description.

**Good**: Shows the specific flow that solves the specific pain named above. Explains the mechanism (why it works), not just features. Has a short "how it works" (3 steps max).

**Bad**: Feature list without context. No connection back to the pain. Wall of screenshots with no narrative.

### 4. CTA
**Job**: One action. Reduce friction. Reduce risk.

**Good**: Single CTA repeated 2–3 times on the page. Microcopy reduces the biggest objection ("No credit card. Cancel anytime." / "First invoice free."). Button text states the outcome, not the action.
- "Get my first invoice paid" > "Submit"
- "See it in my codebase" > "Request demo"

**Bad**: Multiple competing CTAs. Generic button text. No microcopy. Form asking for more than email + one other field at top of funnel.

## What Makes a Good Ad

A good ad does one job: gets the right person to click and sets accurate expectations for what they'll find.

**Four criteria:**
1. **Pain hook first** — opens with a specific painful moment, not a product claim
2. **User language** — sounds like something a customer said, not a marketer wrote
3. **Single CTA** — one action to take, no menu of options
4. **Channel-native format** — looks and feels like organic content on that platform

**Warning signs in ad creative:**
- Leads with the product name or logo
- Uses adjectives like "powerful," "seamless," "robust," "cutting-edge"
- CTA is "Learn More" with no context
- Could run on any product in any category (not specific enough)

## Channel Selection Logic

Match channel to ICP based on four factors:

### 1. Where does the ICP spend time?
- B2B decision makers on LinkedIn, newsletters, podcasts
- Developers on Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter/X, GitHub
- Consumers on Meta (FB/IG), TikTok, YouTube
- High-intent buyers on Google Search

### 2. Awareness level
- **Problem-unaware / Solution-unaware**: Content-first channels (YouTube, newsletters, podcasts). Paid interruption won't work.
- **Solution-aware / Product-aware**: Google Search, retargeting, review sites (G2, Capterra).
- **Most aware**: Direct offer, email, retargeting.

### 3. Ticket size
- < $50/mo or < $500 one-time: Meta, TikTok, Google Search (can close without human touch)
- $500–$5k: LinkedIn, Google Search, retargeting + demo
- > $5k: LinkedIn, outbound, content — paid ads as awareness layer only

### 4. Sales cycle
- Same-day close: Google Search (high intent), Meta (impulse + social proof)
- 1–4 weeks: LinkedIn + email nurture, retargeting
- > 1 month: Content marketing, thought leadership, organic + paid combo

### What NOT to do first
- Don't start with brand awareness campaigns before direct response
- Don't run LinkedIn lead gen forms before the LP converts cold traffic
- Don't use TikTok for B2B enterprise (ticket size mismatch)
- Don't use Google Search for solution-unaware audiences (search volume won't be there)

## Metric Thresholds

Use these to diagnose where the funnel is broken before prescribing a fix.

| Metric | Threshold | Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| Ad CTR (paid social) | < 0.5% | Creative is broken. Fix before touching budget. |
| Ad CTR (search) | < 2% | Ad copy or targeting mismatch |
| LP conversion (cold) | < 2% | LP is broken. Don't touch ad spend. |
| LP conversion (warm/retargeting) | < 10% | LP or offer mismatch |
| Email open rate | < 20% | Subject line or list quality |
| Email CTR | < 2% | Copy or offer mismatch |
| Demo show rate | < 60% | Qualification or reminder sequence broken |
| Demo-to-close | < 20% | Offer, pricing, or objection handling |

**Rule**: Fix the first broken metric from the top. Optimizing CTR when LP converts at 0.5% is wasted effort. Optimizing LP copy when CTR is 0.2% means nobody's seeing the LP anyway.
