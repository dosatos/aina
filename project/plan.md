# Growth Funnel Plan

<!-- The growth-strategist agent updates this file after each session.

## Status
Foundation defined — ready for MVP build and pre-launch funnel work.

## What's Known

### Product Core
- **What it is:** Self-evaluation platform that synthesizes 7 assessment layers into a unified, evolving profile
- **MVP scope (Phase 1):** Layer 1 (Behavioral Dynamics), Layer 3 (Risk & Decision), Layer 7 (Self-Perception Gap / Blindspot Check)
- **Primary audience:** Career pivoters 25-40, mid-career professionals feeling stuck or misaligned
- **Core pain:** Siloed personality test results that don't connect or lead to action
- **Unique mechanism:** Cross-layer synthesis powered by AI — connecting insights across dimensions

### Business Model
- **Freemium:** 1-2 basic assessments free, full suite behind paywall
- **Pricing:** \$49-99 one-time comprehensive OR \$19/mo subscription
- **Primary conversion:** Email capture (free assessment) → paid full profile

### Market Position
- **Main competitors:** 16Personalities (free, popular, weak science), CliftonStrengths (expensive, one-dimensional), Crystal (B2B DISC tool)
- **Gap we fill:** No one offers cross-assessment synthesis, risk/bias layers, living dashboard, or peer perception comparison

## What's Blocked
Nothing critical. Product vision is defined. Ready to move forward on:
- Channel strategy (where to acquire first users)
- Landing page structure (what messaging converts cold → email → paid)
- Ad creative direction (how to hook the right people)

## Decisions Made
1. **Target audience:** Career-oriented professionals 25-40 (not students, not enterprise teams — for now)
2. **Positioning:** "Growth OS" / "Weaponized self-awareness" — serious but not corporate, analytical but not cold
3. **MVP layers:** 1 (Behavioral), 3 (Risk), 7 (Blindspot) — enough for cross-layer synthesis, avoids legal/IP risk, includes viral mechanic
4. **Tone:** Conversational but credible. Avoid HR-speak, woo-woo, and academic jargon.

## In Progress
- Product brief now populated (see product-brief.md)
- Vision consolidated (see docs/combined-vision.md)
- Assessment layer design complete (7 layers defined, research foundations documented)

## Open Questions
1. **Name:** Still TBD (candidates: MirrorMetric, Alchemy Me, Blueprint, Synapse, MirrorMe)
2. **MVP depth:** How much cross-layer synthesis in Phase 1? Just pattern detection or full AI coach?
3. **Go-to-market:** B2C direct (paid ads) or B2B pilot (sell to coaching/HR first)?
4. **Build timeline:** 8 weeks to MVP or longer for deeper AI layer?

## Next Steps

### Pre-Launch (Marketing Foundation)
1. **Run /find-channels** — Identify top acquisition channel for career-oriented professionals 25-40
2. **Run /structure-lp** — Build landing page structure for free assessment → email capture → paid upsell
3. **Run /generate-hooks** — Create ad creative concepts (pain hooks for career misalignment, self-awareness gaps)
4. **Run /validation-smoke-test** — Validate demand before building (waitlist, early-bird offer, or pre-sell assessment)

### Build Phase (Product)
5. Design assessment flow for Layer 1 (Behavioral Dynamics via IPIP Big Five items)
6. Build Layer 3 (Risk & Decision Architecture) custom questions
7. Build Layer 7 (Self-Perception Gap) peer survey mechanism
8. Build AI synthesis engine (cross-layer pattern detection)
9. Design profile dashboard UI

### Launch
10. Run /ship when MVP is ready — launch checklist, smoke test, first users
