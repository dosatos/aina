# Growth Funnel Plan

<!-- The growth-strategist agent updates this file after each session.
     Tracks what's been decided, what's in progress, and what's next. -->

## Status
Not started — product brief not yet filled in.

## What's Known
(agent fills this in after reading product-brief.md)

## What's Blocked
- product-brief.md is empty — cannot start funnel work until ICP, pain, and offer are defined

## Decisions Made
(agent logs key decisions here)

## In Progress
(current work)

## Next Steps
1. Fill in product-brief.md — especially: ICP, core pain, trigger moment, offer, price point
2. Run find-channels to identify top acquisition channel
3. Run generate-hooks for initial ad creative direction
4. Run structure-lp or audit-lp depending on whether LP exists
