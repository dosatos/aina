## Product

- **Name:** TBD (candidates: MirrorMetric, Alchemy Me, Blueprint, Synapse, MirrorMe)
- **One-line description:** A platform that synthesizes multiple personality and performance assessments into a holistic, evolving profile — your "User Manual for Life"
- **Category:** SaaS
- **Website / landing page URL:** Not yet built

## Ideal Customer Profile

- **Who they are:** Career-oriented professionals, ages 25-40, mid-career. Often in tech, creative, or professional services. College-educated. Currently employed but questioning fit or trajectory.
- **Core pain:** Feeling stuck or misaligned mid-career. Have taken multiple personality tests (DISC, MBTI, Gallup, etc.) but results sit in isolated PDFs that don't talk to each other. Want self-awareness but current tools give disconnected data points, not actionable insight.
- **Trigger moment:** Hit a career inflection point (promotion offer they're unsure about, burnout setting in, considering a pivot, or just passed 30/35 and questioning if they're on the right path).
- **Sophistication level:** Aware of solutions / tried alternatives. They've taken personality tests before. They know about MBTI, Enneagram, StrengthsFinder. Looking for something deeper and more integrated.

## Differentiation

- **Unique mechanism:** Cross-layer synthesis. Instead of isolated test results, we connect insights across 7 assessment dimensions (behavioral style, drive, risk profile, execution patterns, relational dynamics, career alignment, self-perception gaps) to surface non-obvious truths. Example: "Your high risk tolerance + low execution consistency means you start ambitious projects but abandon them mid-way. Your motivation is real; your systems aren't."
- **Named enemy:** Siloed personality tests that give you a PDF and leave you to figure out what it means. The enemy is fragmented self-knowledge that doesn't lead to action.
- **Key differentiators:**
  - Cross-assessment synthesis into a unified, evolving profile (not one-time PDFs)
  - Risk & cognitive bias layers alongside personality (no competitor does this)
  - AI-powered contextual analysis and coaching (scenario-based advice, not just types)
  - Blindspot Check (peer perception vs. self-perception comparison with viral mechanic)
  - Living dashboard that grows over time vs. static reports
  - MCP integration (your profile travels with you across AI tools)

## Existing Assets

- **Current ads:** None yet — pre-launch
- **Top 3 competitors:**
  1. 16Personalities (free, MBTI-based, fun but scientifically weak)
  2. CliftonStrengths / Gallup (gold standard, expensive, corporate, one-dimensional)
  3. Crystal (DISC-based, B2B communication tool)

- **Known customer objections:**
  1. "I've already taken personality tests — why is this different?" (Answer: synthesis across tests, not another isolated result)
  2. "Is this scientifically valid or just another online quiz?" (Answer: built on Big Five, prospect theory, established models)
  3. "What do I actually DO with this information?" (Answer: AI coach, actionable sprints, scenario-based advice)

## Voice & Tone

- **Brand tone:** Conversational but credible. Smart without being academic. Self-aware and slightly irreverent. "Weaponized self-awareness" vibe — we're here to help you see yourself clearly, not to make you feel good.
- **What to avoid:** Corporate HR speak. Overly earnest self-help language. Woo-woo spirituality. Cold academic jargon.
