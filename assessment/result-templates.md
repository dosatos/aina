## Archetype Examples

### Archetype 1: High-Autonomy IC Trapped in Process-Heavy Role

**Profile:**
- Q1: 2 (High assertiveness)
- Q2: 2 (Fast pace)
- Q3: 2 (Task-focused)
- Q4: 2 (Low sunk cost bias)
- Q5: 2 (Low loss aversion)
- Q6: 2 (Low reputational risk aversion)
- Q7: A (Lack of autonomy drains me)
- Q8: D (Want high autonomy/ownership)

**Result:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR WIRING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're fast, decisive, and task-focused.

Decision patterns:
• You cut losses fast—sunk cost doesn't trap you
• You take calculated risks for higher upside
• You're willing to take reputational risks when you have data

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MISMATCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're drained by: Lack of autonomy (micromanagement, too many approvals)

This hits you hard because: You're wired for fast decisions and high ownership. Every approval layer feels like friction. You see the solution, know how to execute, and get blocked by process.

Your nervous system interprets this as: "I'm being prevented from doing my job."

The real cost: You're spending energy managing up instead of building. Every delay compounds your frustration because you operate at a faster pace than your environment allows.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE YOU SHINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You want: High autonomy and ownership

Given your wiring, look for:
• Early-stage startups or small teams where you own entire problem domains
• Roles with "build it your way" mandates—outcome accountability, not process compliance
• Managers who give you the problem and trust you to solve it (weekly check-ins, not daily status updates)

You'll thrive when: Someone hands you a goal, a deadline, and gets out of your way.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEXT STEP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Filter your next role for:
1. **Decision authority:** Ask in interviews: "What decisions can I make without approval?"
2. **Manager style:** Look for results-focused leaders, not process-focused ones
3. **Company stage:** Favor <50 people (fewer approval layers)

Red flags to avoid:
• "We have a clear process for everything"
• Multiple sign-offs required for routine decisions
• Manager describes themselves as "hands-on"
```

### Archetype 2: Deliberate Thinker in Fast-Paced Chaos

**Profile:**
- Q1: 1 (Low assertiveness)
- Q2: 1 (Slow/deliberate pace)
- Q3: 1 (People-focused)
- Q4: 1 (Moderate-high sunk cost bias)
- Q5: 1 (High loss aversion)
- Q6: 1 (High reputational risk aversion)
- Q7: B (Unclear expectations / shifting priorities)
- Q8: E (Structured environment with clear processes)

**Result:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR WIRING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're deliberate, facilitative, and balanced between task and people.

Decision patterns:
• You prefer certainty—need to fully understand before committing
• You avoid unnecessary risk when stakes are high
• You value depth over speed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MISMATCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're drained by: Unclear expectations or constantly shifting priorities

This hits you hard because: You're wired to think deeply and systematically. You need to understand the full context before you can do your best work. But your environment keeps moving the goalposts.

Your nervous system interprets this as: "I can't win. I'm solving the wrong problem."

The real cost: You spend energy adapting to chaos instead of going deep. By the time you understand the problem, the requirements have changed. You never get to leverage your natural strength: thorough, high-quality thinking.

Last 3 performance reviews probably mentioned: "Takes longer to ramp up" or "needs more context than we can provide in a fast-moving environment."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE YOU SHINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You want: Structured environment with clear processes

Given your wiring, look for:
• Mature companies (Series C+, or large enterprises) with established processes
• Roles with defined scope and success criteria—where "done" is measurable
• Teams that value quality over speed—where "did it right" beats "shipped fast"

You'll thrive when: You have 2 weeks to solve a well-defined problem and can go as deep as needed.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEXT STEP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Filter your next role for:
1. **Stability:** Ask about roadmap stability. Red flag: "We pivot based on market feedback every 2 weeks"
2. **Process maturity:** Look for "We have a clear planning process" (not "We move fast and break things")
3. **Manager communication:** Ask: "How often do priorities change mid-sprint?"

Red flags to avoid:
• "We're figuring it out as we go"
• "Wear many hats" (code for unclear scope)
• Startup <20 people (too much chaos)
```

### Archetype 3: People-Focused IC Doing Too Much Solo Work

**Profile:**
- Q1: 1 (Low assertiveness - facilitative)
- Q2: 2 (Fast pace - moves quickly)
- Q3: 1 (People-focused)
- Q4: 2 (Low sunk cost bias - rational decisions)
- Q5: 2 (Low loss aversion - takes calculated risks)
- Q6: 2 (Low reputational risk aversion - willing to speak up)
- Q7: E (Too much solo work, not enough collaboration)
- Q8: C (Building and leading teams)

**Result:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR WIRING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're moderately assertive, steady-paced, and people-focused.

Decision patterns:
• You balance speed with thoughtfulness
• You're comfortable with calculated risk
• You lead by building consensus, not dictating direction

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MISMATCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're drained by: Too much solo work, not enough collaboration

This hits you hard because: You're energized by people. You do your best thinking in conversation. You want to coach, align, build shared understanding. But your current role rewards individual output.

Your nervous system interprets this as: "I'm isolated. My strengths don't matter here."

The real cost: You're forcing yourself into deep solo work when your natural advantage is synthesis, alignment, and helping others do their best work. Every Zoom-off head-down day feels draining instead of energizing.

You probably think: "Maybe I'm not technical enough" when the real issue is: you're solving the wrong problems with the wrong tools.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE YOU SHINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You want: Building and leading teams

Given your wiring, look for:
• People management track (lead 2-5 people, own their growth)
• Cross-functional roles (product manager, team lead, program manager)
• Collaborative environments where success = team output, not individual heroics

You'll thrive when: Your job is to make 5 people 20% more effective, not to be a solo 10x contributor.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEXT STEP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Filter your next role for:
1. **Management opportunity:** Ask: "What's the path to managing people here?" (Don't wait 3 years)
2. **Collaboration intensity:** Look for roles with "cross-functional" or "team lead" in the title
3. **Success metrics:** Avoid roles measured purely on individual output

Red flags to avoid:
• "We hire people who can work independently"
• "Minimal meetings culture" (your strength is collaboration)
• IC roles at companies with no clear management track
```

### Archetype 4: Strategic Thinker Stuck in Execution Mode

**Profile:**
- Q1: 2 (High assertiveness)
- Q2: 1 (Slow/deliberate pace)
- Q3: 2 (Task-focused)
- Q4: 2 (Low sunk cost bias - cuts bad projects)
- Q5: 1 (High loss aversion - prefers stability)
- Q6: 2 (Low reputational risk - challenges assumptions)
- Q7: C (Repetitive work without learning/growth)
- Q8: B (Strategic thinking and planning)

**Result:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR WIRING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're deliberate, pragmatic, and task-focused.

Decision patterns:
• You cut bad projects quickly—you see the ROI math
• You prefer stability over high-variance outcomes
• You're willing to challenge assumptions when data supports it

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MISMATCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're drained by: Repetitive work without learning/growth

This hits you hard because: You're wired to think systemically. You see patterns, optimize processes, and spot inefficiencies. But your role has you executing the same playbook on repeat.

Your nervous system interprets this as: "I'm capable of more. This is a waste."

The real cost: You're spending mental energy on work that doesn't require your full cognitive capacity. You're solving the same problem 12 times instead of solving it once at the system level. You're an architect being asked to lay bricks.

The quiet fear: "I'm getting good at something that doesn't matter."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE YOU SHINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You want: Strategic thinking and planning

Given your wiring, look for:
• Senior IC roles (Staff, Principal) where the job is "solve the hard problems"
• Strategy-adjacent roles (chief of staff, BizOps, strategic initiatives)
• Roles with "design the system" mandates, not "execute the system"

You'll thrive when: Your job is to figure out what the team should build, not to build the same thing 100 times.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEXT STEP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Filter your next role for:
1. **Scope:** Ask: "What % of the role is net-new problems vs repeating established processes?"
2. **Seniority:** Target Staff+ IC or strategy roles (avoid "Junior" or "Associate" titles)
3. **Learning budget:** Ask: "How does the company support continuous learning?" (stipend, conference budget, etc.)

Red flags to avoid:
• "Proven playbook" (means: repeat what we already know)
• "High-volume execution" (means: do the same thing 50 times)
• Roles that cap at "Senior" with no Staff+ track
```

## Mismatch Diagnosis Matrix

Use this to map Q7 (drain) + wiring profile → diagnosis insight.

| Drain (Q7) | High Assertiveness + Fast Pace | Low Assertiveness + Slow Pace | High People Focus | High Task Focus |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Lack of autonomy** | "You're wired for ownership. Approvals feel like roadblocks." | "You need space to think deeply. Micromanagement prevents that." | "You can't build relationships under surveillance." | "You see the path. You're blocked from executing." |
| **Unclear expectations** | "You make fast decisions. Shifting goals waste your speed." | "You need stable goals to go deep. Chaos prevents quality work." | "You can't align people when the target keeps moving." | "You optimize systems. Can't optimize what keeps changing." |
| **Repetitive work** | "You're wired to build new things, not repeat old ones." | "You're wired for depth. Repetition doesn't reward deep thinking." | "You're energized by new people/challenges. Repetition drains that." | "You're a systems thinker. Repetition doesn't use that skill." |
| **Too much people mgmt** | "You're wired for fast execution. People problems slow you down." | "You need thinking time. People management consumes it." | "You're good at it, but it's 100% of your day. No variety." | "You're task-focused. People problems feel like distractions." |
| **Too much solo work** | "You're assertive and decisive. You need people to lead." | "You think by talking. Solo work isolates your best skill." | "You're energized by collaboration. Solo work drains you." | "You're productive solo, but miss the strategic interaction." |
| **High stress without control** | "You're wired to act. Stress without agency is torture." | "You mitigate risk by analyzing. Can't do that when out of control." | "You manage stress through relationships. No support system here." | "You control outcomes through execution. Can't execute = can't cope." |
| **Lack of impact** | "You're wired for visible results. Invisibility feels like failure." | "You invest deeply in quality. If it doesn't matter, why invest?" | "You're energized by helping others. No one to help = no meaning." | "You're task-driven. Need to see output matter." |

## Environment Recommendations Matrix

Use this to map Q8 (ideal role) + wiring → specific recommendations.

| Ideal Role (Q8) | High Assertiveness + Fast | Low Assertiveness + Slow | High People Focus | High Task Focus |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Deep technical/specialist** | "IC track at high-growth startup (build fast, own your domain)" | "Research role or large company (time to go deep)" | "Technical lead (mentor while coding)" | "Specialist IC (focus on craft, not people)" |
| **Strategic thinking** | "Chief of Staff, BizOps (fast strategic decisions)" | "Strategy/planning role (time for analysis)" | "Cross-functional strategy (align people)" | "Staff+ IC (solve hard systems problems)" |
| **Building/leading teams** | "High-growth startup manager (build and scale fast)" | "Mature company people manager (develop people deeply)" | "People management (your natural wiring)" | "Results-focused team lead (lead via systems, not relationships)" |
| **High autonomy/ownership** | "Startup IC or founder (own entire problem)" | "Senior IC with defined domain (deep autonomy)" | "Product manager (own outcomes, work with people)" | "Technical founder or senior IC (own, execute)" |
| **Structured environment** | "Process-heavy scale-up (fast, but within systems)" | "Large enterprise (stable, deep processes)" | "Program manager in structured org" | "Operations role in mature company" |
| **Fast-paced/dynamic** | "Startup or growth-stage company (natural fit)" | "Avoid. Mismatch." | "Agency/consulting (new people, new problems)" | "Early-stage startup IC (ship fast, iterate)" |
| **Mix of several** | "Product manager or generalist IC" | "Senior IC at mid-size company" | "Cross-functional role" | "Technical product manager" |

## Usage Guide for Manual Scoring (Phase 0)

**Steps:**
1. Score Q1-Q6 with binary values (1 or 2)
   - Each question has 2 options
   - Option A typically scores 2 (high on dimension)
   - Option B typically scores 1 (low on dimension)
2. Map behavioral wiring:
   - Assertiveness = Q1 (2 = high, 1 = low)
   - Pace = Q2 (2 = fast, 1 = slow)
   - Task/People = Q3 (2 = task-focused, 1 = people-focused)
3. Map decision patterns:
   - Sunk cost = Q4 (2 = low bias, 1 = high bias)
   - Loss aversion = Q5 (2 = low aversion, 1 = high aversion)
   - Reputational risk = Q6 (2 = low aversion, 1 = high aversion)
4. Look up Q7 + wiring in Mismatch Matrix → diagnosis
5. Look up Q8 + wiring in Environment Matrix → recommendations
6. Fill in template with personalized language

**Time per result (manual):** 2-3 minutes once you're familiar with the matrices (faster with binary scoring).

## Quality Check

**Good result feels like:**
- "This described me perfectly"
- "How did you know that?"
- "This explains why I've been stuck"

**Bad result feels like:**
- "Just another personality test"
- "Too generic"
- "Doesn't tell me what to do"

**If results feel generic:**
- Add more specific behavioral examples in mismatch section
- Use their exact language from Q7/Q8
- Include role-level context from Q9/Q10
