# Phase 0 Assessment Questions (Final)

**Total Questions:** 7
**Estimated Time:** 7-10 minutes
**Format:** Multiple choice (2-4 options per question)

---

## Question 1: Meeting Facilitation

When your team is debating two directions and can't agree, you're more likely to:

- [ ] Make the call yourself so the team can move forward
- [ ] Facilitate the discussion until the group reaches alignment

**Measures:** Assertiveness (directive vs. consensus-building)

---

## Question 2: Launch vs. Analyze

When starting a new initiative, you're more likely to:

- [ ] Launch a rough version quickly and refine based on feedback
- [ ] Analyze risks and edge cases before taking visible action

**Measures:** Pace preference (action-bias vs. deliberation)

---

## Question 3: Team Behind Schedule

You're leading a project that's behind schedule. You're more likely to:

- [ ] Restructure the timeline and cut scope to hit the deadline
- [ ] Check in with the team to understand what's slowing them down before changing the plan

**Measures:** Orientation (task-focused vs. people-focused)

---

## Question 4: Internal Tool Development

You've spent 4 months and $30K of budget building an internal tool your team was excited about. After launch, adoption is at 15% — most people quietly went back to the old process.

Your engineering lead believes two more sprints could fix the UX issues. Meanwhile, a teammate flags a well-reviewed off-the-shelf tool that costs $500/month and covers 80% of your use case.

You:

- [ ] Invest the two sprints — your team built this with specific workflows in mind, and the learnings from V1 make V2 much stronger
- [ ] Run both side by side for two weeks and let usage data decide
- [ ] Switch to the off-the-shelf tool and redeploy engineering time to higher-impact work
- [ ] Survey the team to understand why adoption was low before committing to either path

**Measures:** Sunk cost bias (investment recovery vs. cutting losses)

---

## Question 5: Probabilistic Gain

Choose one option (assume this is a one-time investment decision):

- [ ] 80% chance to gain $50,000; 20% chance to gain nothing
- [ ] Guaranteed $38,000

**Measures:** Financial risk tolerance in gain frame

---

## Question 6: Mixed Gain/Loss

You must choose one (assume you can comfortably absorb the potential loss):

- [ ] 50% chance to gain $120,000; 50% chance to lose $40,000
- [ ] Guaranteed gain of $35,000

**Measures:** Loss aversion (risk tolerance in mixed frame)

---

## Question 7: Contrarian LinkedIn Post

You're considering publishing a strong contrarian opinion on LinkedIn about an industry trend. It could increase your visibility — but may alienate some peers and potential employers.

You:

- [ ] Publish it as written
- [ ] Tone it down to reduce backlash
- [ ] Share it privately with trusted peers first
- [ ] Decide it's not worth the reputational risk

**Measures:** Reputational risk tolerance (visibility vs. safety)

---

## Implementation Notes

**Question order:** Present in this exact sequence
- Q1-3: Behavioral wiring (ease into assessment)
- Q4-7: Decision patterns (higher cognitive load)

**Answer format:**
- Q1-3, Q5-6: Radio buttons (single choice)
- Q4, Q7: Radio buttons (single choice, 4 options)

**Progress indicator:** Show "Question X of 7" at top

**Time estimate:** Display "~7-10 minutes" at start

**No back button:** Prevent changing answers (cleaner data)

## Scoring Key (Internal Use Only)

### Behavioral Dimensions (Q1-Q3)

**Q1 - Assertiveness:**
- Option A → High assertiveness (decisive, directive)
- Option B → Low assertiveness (facilitative, consensus-seeking)

**Q2 - Pace:**
- Option A → Fast pace (action-biased, iteration)
- Option B → Deliberate pace (analytical, risk-aware)

**Q3 - Orientation:**
- Option A → Task-focused (outcome-driven, deadline-oriented)
- Option B → People-focused (relationship-driven, team-first)

### Decision Patterns (Q4-Q7)

**Q4 - Sunk Cost Awareness:**
- Option A → Low (sunk cost bias - "4 months invested")
- Option B → Medium-High (data-driven, testing mindset)
- Option C → High (cuts losses, redeploys resources)
- Option D → Medium (people-focused deliberation)

**Q5 - Risk Tolerance (Gain Frame):**
- Option A → Risk-seeking (EV = $40K, takes uncertainty)
- Option B → Risk-averse (certainty preference, EV = $38K)

**Q6 - Loss Aversion:**
- Option A → Risk-seeking/Low loss aversion (EV = $40K, accepts loss possibility)
- Option B → Loss-averse (avoids loss risk, takes guaranteed $35K)

**Combined Q5+Q6:**
- Both A → Risk-seeking across frames
- Both B → Risk-averse across frames
- Mixed → Selective/context-dependent risk tolerance

**Q7 - Reputational Risk:**
- Option A → High tolerance (visibility prioritized)
- Option B → Medium-high (measured boldness)
- Option C → Medium-low (safety-first testing)
- Option D → Low tolerance (safety prioritized)

## Result Archetypes (8 Patterns)

Based on scoring, users map to one of 8 archetypes:

1. Fast Executor + Risk-Averse
2. Deliberate Builder + Sunk Cost Aware
3. Decisive Leader + People-Focused
4. Fast + Task-Focused + Risk-Seeking
5. Deliberate + People-Focused + Sunk Cost Trapped
6. Fast Executor + Low Reputational Risk
7. Analytical + Sunk Cost Aware + Risk-Seeking
8. Decisive + Task-Focused + Reputation-Cautious

## Quality Checklist

Before deployment:

- [ ] All questions use clear, specific scenarios (not abstract)
- [ ] No "right" answers (all options defensible)
- [ ] Financial amounts specific ($30K, $500/month, not "a lot")
- [ ] Tech/professional context throughout (internal tools, LinkedIn, salary)
- [ ] No jargon or academic language
- [ ] Total time tested with 5+ people (target: 7-12 min median)
- [ ] Questions display correctly on mobile
- [ ] Progress indicator works
- [ ] Can't submit without answering all questions

**Status:** Final - Ready for implementation
**Next Step:** Choose platform (Google Form, Typeform, or custom) and build
