# Phase 0 Micro-Assessment Design

**Created:** February 21, 2026
**Purpose:** Ultra-short career diagnosis (7-10 minutes) for Phase 0 validation
**Based on:** Tier 1 Essential Questions from compiled-questions

---

## Design Principles

**Landing page promises:**
- "10-minute career diagnosis"
- Shows "strengths, blind spots, where you shine"
- Diagnoses "mismatch between how you're wired and what role rewards"
- "Root cause, not labels"

**Micro-assessment delivers:**
- 7 behavioral questions (high-signal Tier 1 only)
- Instant diagnosis paragraph
- 2-3 specific insights about wiring + role mismatch
- Email capture for "full report" (future)

**Key constraint:** Must feel diagnostic, not like a personality quiz

---

## Question Flow (7 Questions)

### Part 1: Behavioral Wiring (3 questions)

**Q1: Meeting Facilitation [Assertiveness]**

"When your team is debating two directions and can't agree, you're more likely to:"

- (A) Make the call yourself so the team can move forward
- (B) Facilitate the discussion until the group reaches alignment

**Q2: Launch vs. Analyze [Pace]**

"When starting a new initiative, you're more likely to:"

- (A) Launch a rough version quickly and refine based on feedback
- (B) Analyze risks and edge cases before taking visible action

**Q3: Team Behind Schedule [People vs Task]**

"You're leading a project that's behind schedule. You're more likely to:"

- (A) Restructure the timeline and cut scope to hit the deadline
- (B) Check in with the team to understand what's slowing them down before changing the plan

---

### Part 2: Decision Architecture (4 questions)

**Q4: Internal Tool Development [Sunk Cost Bias]**

"You've spent 4 months and $30K building an internal tool. After launch, adoption is at 15% — most people went back to the old process. Your engineering lead believes two more sprints could fix the UX issues. Meanwhile, a teammate flags a well-reviewed off-the-shelf tool that costs $500/month and covers 80% of your use case. You:"

- (A) Invest the two sprints — your team built this with specific workflows in mind
- (B) Run both side by side for two weeks and let usage data decide
- (C) Switch to the off-the-shelf tool and redeploy engineering time to higher-impact work
- (D) Survey the team to understand why adoption was low before committing to either path

**Q5: Probabilistic Gain [Financial Risk Tolerance]**

"Choose one option (assume this is a one-time decision):"

- (A) 80% chance to gain $50,000; 20% chance to gain nothing
- (B) Guaranteed $38,000

**Q6: Mixed Gain/Loss [Loss Aversion]**

"You must choose one (assume you can comfortably absorb the potential loss):"

- (A) 50% chance to gain $120,000; 50% chance to lose $40,000
- (B) Guaranteed gain of $35,000

**Q7: Contrarian LinkedIn Post [Reputational Risk]**

"You're considering publishing a strong contrarian opinion on LinkedIn about an industry trend. It could increase your visibility — but may alienate some peers and potential employers. You:"

- (A) Publish it as written
- (B) Tone it down to reduce backlash
- (C) Share it privately with trusted peers first
- (D) Decide it's not worth the reputational risk

## Instant Result Logic

### Scoring Model

**Behavioral Dimensions (Q1-Q3):**
- **Assertiveness:** Q1(A) = high, Q1(B) = low
- **Pace:** Q2(A) = fast, Q2(B) = deliberate
- **Orientation:** Q3(A) = task-focused, Q3(B) = people-focused

**Decision Patterns (Q4-Q7):**
- **Sunk Cost Awareness:** Q4(C) = high, Q4(A) = low, Q4(B/D) = medium
- **Risk Tolerance (Financial):** Q5(A) + Q6(A) = risk-seeking; Q5(B) + Q6(B) = risk-averse; mixed = selective
- **Risk Tolerance (Reputation):** Q7(A/B) = high, Q7(C) = medium, Q7(D) = low

### Result Template Structure

**Format:**
```
[HEADLINE]: Your wiring in 2 sentences

[MISMATCH]: Where this creates friction

[STRENGTH]: What environments you shine in

[NEXT STEP]: One specific action
```

## Sample Results (8 Archetypes)

### Archetype 1: Fast Executor + Risk-Averse

**Your wiring:**
You move fast, decide quickly, and push for action. But you're cautious with financial and reputational risk — you test the waters before jumping.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're stuck in roles that reward bold bets, not smart iteration. Your managers see "slow to commit" when you're actually being strategic.

**What environments you shine in:**
Rapid execution roles with clear guardrails. Think: scaling proven products, operational excellence, technical delivery with defined scope.

**Next step:**
Filter next role for: outcome-based evaluation (not "big swings"), structured decision processes, emphasis on execution speed over vision.

---

### Archetype 2: Deliberate Builder + Sunk Cost Aware

**Your wiring:**
You analyze before acting, build for the long term, and cut losses fast when data says move on. You're methodical but unsentimental.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're stuck in "move fast and break things" cultures where your deliberation looks like hesitation. Meanwhile, you watch people throw good money after bad.

**What environments you shine in:**
Strategic planning, product architecture, long-cycle decisions where thinking ahead pays off. Places that value "slow is smooth, smooth is fast."

**Next step:**
Filter next role for: emphasis on strategy over tactics, tolerance for deep analysis, decision authority to kill underperforming initiatives.

---

### Archetype 3: Decisive Leader + People-Focused

**Your wiring:**
You make the call when teams are stuck, but you check in with people first. You lead through clarity and care, not just authority.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're in high-speed environments that reward "just decide" over "decide together." Your empathy reads as slowness. Your team loves you; your boss wants more speed.

**What environments you shine in:**
People leadership, team building, cultures that value psychological safety and long-term retention over short-term velocity.

**Next step:**
Filter next role for: explicit people leadership track (not just IC→manager default), managers who model empathy, orgs measured on retention not just delivery.

---

### Archetype 4: Fast + Task-Focused + Risk-Seeking

**Your wiring:**
You bias toward action, hit deadlines over consensus, and take big swings. You're comfortable with high risk if the upside is there.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're in slow-moving orgs that reward caution and consensus. Every decision needs 3 approvals. Your speed looks reckless.

**What environments you shine in:**
Startups, 0→1 projects, founder-track roles. Anywhere "bias toward action" is doctrine, not a warning.

**Next step:**
Filter next role for: founder or early-stage team, fast decision loops, explicit tolerance for failure, equity upside that rewards risk-taking.

---

### Archetype 5: Deliberate + People-Focused + Sunk Cost Trapped

**Your wiring:**
You build slowly, care about team dynamics, but you hold onto failing projects too long. You see potential when data says pivot.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're burning out trying to save initiatives that should be killed. Your loyalty to people and projects costs you momentum.

**What environments you shine in:**
Roles with clear decision frameworks and defined exit criteria. Cultures that separate "caring about people" from "holding onto sunk costs."

**Next step:**
Learn to diagnose: Is this people investment or sunk cost? Set hard checkpoints on projects. Get external perspective before doubling down.

---

### Archetype 6: Fast Executor + Low Reputational Risk

**Your wiring:**
You ship fast, make calls quickly, but you avoid visibility. You'd rather execute in the background than take credit publicly.

**Where this creates friction:**
Your work is invisible. Promotions go to people who self-promote. You resent that LinkedIn posts matter, but you won't play the game.

**What environments you shine in:**
High-trust teams where results speak for themselves. Small companies where everyone knows your work. Cultures that hate self-promotion.

**Next step:**
Either: (1) Accept visibility is part of the job and build that skill, or (2) Filter for orgs that explicitly reward heads-down execution (rare but they exist).

---

### Archetype 7: Analytical + Sunk Cost Aware + Risk-Seeking (Financial)

**Your wiring:**
You analyze deeply, cut losses fast, and take calculated financial risks. You're strategic about when to hold and when to fold.

**Where this creates friction:**
You're in roles that reward gut instinct over analysis, or cautious cultures that punish bold bets. Your analysis looks like overthinking; your risk appetite scares people.

**What environments you shine in:**
Investment decisions, strategic planning with upside optionality, founder/CFO-track roles where you control the portfolio.

**Next step:**
Filter next role for: decision authority over budgets, tolerance for calculated risk, cultures that trust data-driven bold moves.

---

### Archetype 8: Decisive + Task-Focused + Reputation-Cautious

**Your wiring:**
You make fast calls, prioritize outcomes over feelings, but you avoid public visibility. You lead by shipping, not by posting.

**Where this creates friction:**
Promotions go to people with "executive presence" (code for: speaks at conferences, has LinkedIn following). Your results don't matter if no one sees them.

**What environments you shine in:**
Execution-heavy IC roles, technical leadership without people management, orgs that reward shipping over storytelling.

**Next step:**
Either: Build a "personal brand" strategy (even if it feels gross), or explicitly filter for IC career tracks with strong comp and low visibility requirements.

---

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Google Form + Manual Result (Fastest)

**Build time:** 30 minutes

**How:**
1. Create Google Form with 7 questions
2. At end: "Check your email for results"
3. Manually send archetype result based on responses (first 50 users)
4. Collect emails in spreadsheet

**Pros:** Ship today, no code, test messaging before automating
**Cons:** Not instant, manual work, doesn't scale

---

### Option B: Custom HTML + JavaScript (Medium)

**Build time:** 2-3 hours

**How:**
1. Single-page form with 7 questions
2. JavaScript scoring logic
3. Display result instantly on same page
4. Email capture modal after result
5. POST to Airtable/Zapier webhook

**Pros:** Instant results, feels professional, automated
**Cons:** Requires front-end work, scoring logic needs testing

---

### Option C: Typeform + Zapier (Balanced)

**Build time:** 1 hour

**How:**
1. Build in Typeform (better UX than Google Forms)
2. Logic jumps to different result pages based on answers
3. Email capture at end
4. Zapier → Airtable for storage

**Pros:** Better UX, some automation, no code
**Cons:** Limited branching logic, may need Typeform paid plan

---

## Recommendation: Start with Option A (Google Form)

**Why:**
- Ship in 30 minutes
- Test if ANYONE cares before building automation
- Learn which archetypes resonate from manual sends
- Iterate messaging based on responses

**After 50 responses:**
- If >60% completion rate → build Option B (custom page)
- If <40% completion rate → fix questions, not implementation

---

## Landing Page Alignment Check

**Current promises:**
✅ "10-minute career diagnosis" → 7 questions ≈ 7-10 min
✅ "Strengths, blind spots, where you shine" → Result template has all 3
✅ "Mismatch between wiring and role" → Explicit mismatch section
✅ "Root cause, not labels" → No types, shows behavior + consequence
✅ "For People in Tech" → Scenarios are tech-heavy (internal tools, LinkedIn, salary)

**Gaps to address:**
- Landing page says "15 behavioral questions" but we have 7 → Update copy to "7 key questions"
- Landing page shows "Structure need: 0.78" numerical scores → Don't promise numbers in Phase 0
- Footer says "Built on Big Five + Holland Codes" → True but not fully implemented yet

**Quick fixes needed:**
1. Change "15 behavioral questions" → "7 diagnostic questions"
2. Remove numerical score promises from "How It Works" section
3. Keep methodology footer (signals credibility even if not fully implemented)

---

## Success Metrics (Phase 0)

**Quantitative:**
- Completion rate >60% (started → finished all 7 questions)
- Email capture rate >50% (saw result → gave email)
- Time to complete: 7-12 minutes median

**Qualitative:**
- "This actually described me" reactions
- People sharing results organically
- DMs asking "when is full version ready?"

**Red flags:**
- Completion rate <40% → Questions too hard/long
- Email capture <30% → Result not compelling
- Comments saying "just another personality test" → Positioning failed

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide implementation:** Option A (Google Form), B (Custom), or C (Typeform)
2. **Fix landing page copy** to match 7-question scope
3. **Write result templates** for all 8 archetypes
4. **Set up email capture backend**
5. **Test with 5 people** before public launch
6. **Deploy and link from CTA button**

---

## Open Questions

1. **Do we show "archetype name"?** (e.g., "Fast Executor + Risk-Averse")
   - **Pro:** Memorable, shareable
   - **Con:** Feels like labeling (we promised "not labels")
   - **Recommendation:** Show archetype internally, not to user

2. **Do we ask demographics?** (age, role, years experience)
   - **Pro:** Better segmentation, validate ICP
   - **Con:** Adds friction, people drop off
   - **Recommendation:** Ask AFTER result + email capture (optional)

3. **How do we score Q4 (4-option sunk cost)?**
   - A = sunk cost bias (0)
   - B = data-driven (1)
   - C = decisive, cost-aware (2)
   - D = people-focused deliberation (1)
   - **Recommendation:** Use as secondary signal, not primary

4. **What's the "full report" we promise?**
   - **Phase 0:** Just email saying "we're building this, you're on the list"
   - **Phase 1:** Actual full 7-layer profile
   - **Important:** Don't promise delivery timeline

**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation decision
