## 5. SUNK COST BIAS (3 scenarios)

Tests susceptibility to continuing investment based on past commitment rather than future value.

---

### Q13: Internal Tool Development [Scenario] ⭐

**Source:** ANT Q17 | **Signal Strength:** 10/10 | **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL**

"You've spent 4 months and $30K of budget building an internal tool your team was excited about. After launch, adoption is at 15% — most people quietly went back to the old process. Your engineering lead believes two more sprints could fix the UX issues. Meanwhile, a teammate flags a well-reviewed off-the-shelf tool that costs $500/month and covers 80% of your use case. You:"

○ (A) Invest the two sprints — your team built this with specific workflows in mind, and the learnings from V1 make V2 much stronger
○ (B) Run both side by side for two weeks and let usage data decide
○ (C) Switch to the off-the-shelf tool and redeploy engineering time to higher-impact work
○ (D) Survey the team to understand why adoption was low before committing to either path

**Why This Question:**
- **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL** — Most detailed financial anchoring in all three sources
- Specific dollar amounts ($30K sunk, $500/month alternative) enable clear cost comparison
- Four options reveal different decision-making philosophies (not just sunk cost)
- Real-world scenario with genuine trade-offs (team learning, switching costs, opportunity cost)
- Option phrasings avoid obvious "right" answers

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q16:** Side project scenario with less detailed financial framing
- **OPAI Q16:** Similar side project scenario but weaker financial specifics

### Q14: Partnership Investment [Scenario]

**Source:** ANT Q19 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"You've been pursuing a strategic partnership for 6 months. You've had 12 meetings, built a custom demo, and involved your CEO in two calls. The partner keeps expressing interest but delays signing. A new potential partner reaches out proactively — smaller company, but they're ready to start immediately. You:"

○ (A) Stay focused on the original partner — you're too deep in to walk away, and the bigger deal is worth the wait
○ (B) Pursue both simultaneously, even though it'll stretch your team thin
○ (C) Set a two-week deadline for the original partner and shift focus to the new one if they don't commit
○ (D) Drop the original partner and go all-in on the new opportunity — momentum matters more than size

**Why This Question:**
- Interpersonal sunk cost (relationship investment vs. financial)
- Status bias element (bigger partner vs. smaller)
- Option A explicitly names the sunk cost fallacy ("too deep in to walk away")
- Tests opportunity cost awareness and decisiveness under uncertainty

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q22:** Project 80% complete but lower ROI — overlaps with professional incentives
- **OPAI Q23:** Mentoring investment — good but less business-focused (moved to Q15)

---

### Q15: Mentoring Investment [Scenario]

**Source:** OPAI Q23 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"You've been mentoring a junior team member for a year. Despite significant time invested, performance hasn't improved much. You're deciding whether to continue investing your time. You:"

○ (A) Continue mentoring — improvement takes time
○ (B) Set a clear performance checkpoint and timeline
○ (C) Transition responsibility to someone else
○ (D) Reassign them to a different role better aligned with strengths

**Why This Question:**
- Interpersonal sunk cost with emotional/relational dimension
- Tests willingness to reallocate personal time investment
- All four options are defensible management approaches
- Complements Q13-Q14 by focusing on people investment vs. financial/strategic

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- None — this is the best people-focused sunk cost scenario across all sources

---

---

## 6. FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE (3 questions)

Tests revealed preferences under probabilistic gains/losses and career financial trade-offs.

---

### Q16: Probabilistic Gain (80/20) [Risk Trade-off] ⭐

**Source:** OPAI Q24 | **Signal Strength:** 10/10 | **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL**

"Choose one option:

○ (A) 80% chance to gain $50,000; 20% chance to gain nothing
○ (B) Guaranteed $38,000

(Assume this is a one-time investment decision.)"

**Why This Question:**
- **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL** — Pure expected value test with no confounding variables
- Expected value of A = $40K (vs. guaranteed $38K) — close enough to reveal risk preference
- Tests Prospect Theory's gain-frame prediction (risk aversion in gains)
- Clean probabilistic framing eliminates ambiguity
- Mathematically literate respondents can calculate EV; reveals if they choose EV or certainty

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q21:** 80% chance $15K vs 20% lose $10K — mixed gain/loss complicates interpretation
- **ANT Q20:** Salary vs. equity — adds career context and timeline ambiguity (moved to Q18)

---

### Q17: Mixed Gain/Loss (50/50) [Risk Trade-off] ⭐

**Source:** OPAI Q25 | **Signal Strength:** 10/10 | **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL**

"You must choose one:

○ (A) 50% chance to gain $120,000; 50% chance to lose $40,000
○ (B) Guaranteed gain of $35,000

(Assume you can comfortably absorb the potential loss.)"

**Why This Question:**
- **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL** — Tests loss aversion in mixed frame
- Expected value of A = $40K (vs. guaranteed $35K) — reveals if loss frame shifts preference
- "(Assume you can comfortably absorb the loss)" controls for risk capacity
- Pair with Q16 to detect frame-dependent risk tolerance shifts
- Classic behavioral economics construct measurement

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- None in other sources match this methodological rigor

---

### Q18: Salary vs. Equity [Risk Trade-off]

**Source:** ANT Q20 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"You're choosing between two compensation packages at companies you're equally excited about:

○ Company A: $160K base salary, standard benefits, predictable 3-5% annual raises
○ Company B: $115K base salary + equity stake. If the company hits its targets (which leadership believes is likely), your equity could be worth $200K-$400K in 3-4 years. If it doesn't, the equity is worth nothing.

Which do you choose?"

**Why This Question:**
- Real-world career decision that candidates actually face
- Longer time horizon (3-4 years) tests patience and belief in upside
- Uncertainty phrase ("which leadership believes is likely") adds ambiguity
- Option A total comp over 4 years ≈ $660K; Option B best case ≈ $660-860K — reveals risk vs. upside preference

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q18:** Less detailed financial framing (lacks specific equity value ranges)

---

---

## 7. CAREER/REPUTATIONAL RISK (1 question)

Tests willingness to take reputational risks for potential visibility gains.

---

### Q19: Contrarian LinkedIn Post [Scenario] ⭐

**Source:** OPAI Q19 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10 | **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL**

"You're considering publishing a strong contrarian opinion on LinkedIn about an industry trend. It could increase your visibility — but may alienate some peers and potential employers. You:"

○ (A) Publish it as written
○ (B) Tone it down to reduce backlash
○ (C) Share it privately with trusted peers first
○ (D) Decide it's not worth the reputational risk

**Why This Question:**
- **TIER 1 ESSENTIAL** — Pure reputational risk without financial confounds
- Specific platform (LinkedIn) and consequence (alienate peers/employers) reduce ambiguity
- Four options reveal different risk mitigation strategies
- Timely and universally relatable in modern professional context
- Tests willingness to prioritize visibility over safety

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q21:** "Senior role vs. lateral move" — conflates learning orientation with risk tolerance
- **GEM Q18:** "Stable vs. startup role" — overlaps with financial risk (Q16-Q18)

---

---

## 8. ANALYTICAL VS. INTUITIVE DECISION-MAKING (2 questions)

Tests preference for data-driven vs. gut-feel decision-making under uncertainty.

---

### Q20: Hiring Decision [Scenario]

**Source:** OPAI Q20 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"You're hiring a senior engineer. One candidate has stronger measurable credentials; another gives you a strong intuitive sense of long-term fit, though their resume is less impressive. You:"

○ (A) Choose the stronger resume
○ (B) Choose the candidate who feels like a better long-term fit
○ (C) Design an additional structured test before deciding
○ (D) Involve more stakeholders to triangulate perspectives

**Why This Question:**
- Direct analytical (credentials) vs. intuitive (gut feel) trade-off
- High-stakes decision that reveals true preference under pressure
- Option C and D reveal tolerance for process/delay vs. decisiveness
- Universally applicable scenario across industries

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q20:** Nearly identical but less polished phrasing
- **ANT Q22:** Technical architecture decision — overlaps with structure preference

---

### Q21: Market Entry Signal [Scenario]

**Source:** ANT Q23 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"You're evaluating whether to enter a new market segment. Your data analysis shows modest but positive indicators — the opportunity looks reasonable but not a slam dunk. However, three customers you deeply respect have independently told you this segment is 'where everything is heading.' You:"

○ (A) Trust the customer signal — pattern recognition from smart people in the market is hard to quantify but often right
○ (B) Invest in a deeper quantitative analysis before making a commitment
○ (C) Run a small, time-boxed pilot to generate your own data
○ (D) Weigh both inputs equally and go with whichever direction they converge on

**Why This Question:**
- Tests intuitive (customer signal) vs. analytical (quantitative) preference
- Unique "smart people you respect" framing raises stakes of ignoring intuition
- Strategic decision context (not just tactical hiring)
- Four options reveal different decision-making philosophies

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- None — this is unique across all three sources

---

---

## 9. LOSS AVERSION (1 question)

Tests willingness to exit underperforming investments to avoid realizing losses.

---

### Q22: Side Project Exit [Scenario]

**Source:** OPAI Q21 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"You invested personal savings into a side project. It's not failing, but growth is slower than expected. You could exit now with a small loss — or continue for another year with uncertain upside. You:"

○ (A) Exit now and redeploy capital
○ (B) Continue — there's still a path to upside
○ (C) Reduce involvement but keep optionality
○ (D) Seek external funding to extend runway

**Why This Question:**
- Pure loss aversion without sunk cost confound (explicitly "small loss" not large investment)
- Personal financial stake raises emotional investment
- "Slower than expected" is realistically ambiguous (not clear failure)
- Option C tests optionality thinking (modern sophisticated approach)

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q19:** Stock loss scenario is more abstract/hypothetical
- **ANT Q25:** Product line cannibalization overlaps with strategic planning

---

---

## 10. OVERCONFIDENCE / ANCHORING (2 questions)

Tests susceptibility to anchoring bias and overconfidence in own projections.

---

### Q23: Salary Negotiation Anchoring [Scenario]

**Source:** OPAI Q22 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"You're negotiating salary. The employer's first offer is lower than expected. You had privately hoped for more but didn't state a number upfront. You:"

○ (A) Counter slightly above their number
○ (B) Counter with your original internal target
○ (C) Ask for a broader compensation review (bonus, equity, flexibility)
○ (D) Accept if it's within a reasonable range

**Why This Question:**
- Tests susceptibility to anchoring bias (option A = anchored to their number)
- Universally relatable scenario
- Option C reveals creative problem-solving vs. linear negotiation
- Low social desirability (all options defensible)

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q26:** Revenue forecasting — requires business context not all respondents have
- **GEM Q24:** Mentor timeline projection — less universally applicable (moved to Q24)

---

### Q24: Mentor Timeline Projection [Scenario]

**Source:** GEM Q24 | **Signal Strength:** 7/10

"A reliable mentor tells you that a new market you are entering is 'extremely difficult' and usually takes 2 years to break even. Your internal projections say you can do it in 9 months. You:"

○ (A) Trust your data-driven projections and stick to the 9-month plan
○ (B) Split the difference and re-forecast for 15 months
○ (C) Adopt the mentor's 2-year timeline as the baseline for your budget

**Why This Question:**
- Tests overconfidence (trusting own projections despite expert warning)
- Anchoring bias (mentor's 2 years becomes reference point)
- Option B reveals anchoring susceptibility (splitting difference)
- Planning conservatism vs. aggressive optimism

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q26:** More complex scenario but less focused on overconfidence

---

---

## 11. EMERGENCY DECISION-MAKING (1 question)

Tests decision-making under time pressure with explicit risk trade-offs.

---

### Q25: Hotfix vs. Full Solution [Scenario]

**Source:** GEM Q25 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"An urgent bug is affecting 5% of your users. You can deploy a 'hotfix' in 10 minutes that has a small chance of breaking things for another 2%, or you can wait 4 hours for a fully tested permanent fix. You:"

○ (A) Deploy the 10-minute hotfix immediately to stop the bleeding
○ (B) Wait the 4 hours to ensure no further regressions occur

**Why This Question:**
- Tests decision-making under time pressure with explicit trade-offs
- Specific numbers (5%, 2%, 10 min, 4 hours) eliminate ambiguity
- Reveals risk tolerance in operational crisis
- Both options are defensible engineering decisions

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- None in other sources test emergency pace under explicit risk trade-off

---

---

## 12. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION (2 follow-ups)

Measures metacognitive awareness by comparing stated confidence to decision quality.

---

### Q26: Confidence Calibration (After Sunk Cost Scenario) [Scale]

**Source:** ANT Q18 (follows Q13) | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"How confident are you that your answer to the previous question is the best course of action?"

1 (Not confident at all) → 10 (Extremely confident)

**Why This Question:**
- Detects overconfidence by comparing stated confidence to actual decision quality
- Positioned after high-complexity scenario (Q13 — internal tool with 4 options)
- Metacognitive awareness measurement
- Data can be analyzed against behavioral outcomes

---

### Q27: Confidence Calibration (After Market Entry Scenario) [Scale]

**Source:** ANT Q24 (follows Q21) | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"How confident are you that your answer to the previous question is the best course of action?"

1 (Not confident at all) → 10 (Extremely confident)

**Why This Question:**
- Second confidence calibration after different scenario type (analytical vs. intuitive)
- Enables comparison of confidence across different decision domains
- Tests consistency of metacognitive accuracy

**Note:** Both ANT and GEM suggest confidence calibrations; OPAI does not. Consensus is to include 2 strategically positioned calibrations (after complex scenarios).

## Scoring Guidance for Layer 3

### Binary Flags (Bias Detection)

**Sunk Cost Susceptibility (Q13-Q15)**
- Flag if: Choosing option A on 2+ out of 3 scenarios
- Interpretation: Tendency to continue commitments based on past investment

**Financial Risk Aversion (Q16-Q18)**
- Q16: B = risk-averse (prefer certainty)
- Q17: B = loss-averse (mixed frame shifts preference from Q16)
- Q18: A = risk-averse career choices
- **Profile:**
  - All B/A = Highly risk-averse
  - Mix = Context-dependent
  - All A/A/B = Risk-seeking in abstract scenarios, cautious in career

**Reputational Risk Profile (Q19)**
- A = High risk tolerance
- B = Moderate risk with mitigation
- C = Low risk, needs validation
- D = Risk-averse

**Decision Style (Q20-Q21)**
- Analytical: Choosing A (Q20), B (Q21)
- Intuitive: Choosing B (Q20), A (Q21)
- Process-oriented: Choosing C or D consistently

**Loss Aversion (Q22)**
- A = Willing to realize loss
- B = Loss-averse (holding to avoid realizing loss)
- C/D = Sophisticated optionality thinking

**Anchoring Susceptibility (Q23-Q24)**
- Q23-A or Q24-B = Anchored to external reference point
- Q23-B or Q24-A = Independent of anchors

**Emergency Decision Style (Q25)**
- A = Bias toward action under pressure
- B = Risk-averse even under time pressure

### Confidence Calibration Analysis (Q26-Q27)

**Overconfidence Detection:**
- High confidence (8-10) after choosing option A in sunk cost scenarios → Overconfident
- High confidence after choosing intuitive options (Q20-B, Q21-A) → Potentially overconfident if actual outcomes don't justify

**Appropriate Confidence:**
- Moderate confidence (5-7) after complex scenarios = Good metacognitive awareness
- Low confidence (1-4) consistently = Underconfident or high uncertainty tolerance
