# Layer 1: Behavioral Dynamics Questions

**12 Questions | Target Time: 5-6 minutes**

Natural behavioral tendencies and social/professional presence across four core dimensions:
- Assertiveness (Q1-Q3)
- Pace Preference (Q4-Q6)
- People vs Task Orientation (Q7-Q9)
- Structure Preference (Q10-Q12)

---

## 1. ASSERTIVENESS (3 questions)

Measures comfort with taking charge, directness in communication, and proactive leadership.

---

### Q1: Meeting Facilitation [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** ANT Q1 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"When your team is debating two directions and can't agree, you're more likely to:"

○ (A) Make the call yourself so the team can move forward
○ (B) Facilitate the discussion until the group reaches alignment

**Why This Question:**
- Pure assertiveness vs. consensus-building trade-off without confounding variables
- Common scenario that reveals decision-making authority comfort
- Both options are professionally defensible (no social desirability bias)
- High signal for leadership style and meeting presence

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q1:** Similar construct but adds confounding "timeline slip" stress variable
- **OPAI Q1:** Similar but less balanced (option A sounds more aggressive: "even if it creates tension")

---

### Q2: Critical Feedback Delivery [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** ANT Q2 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"A colleague presents an idea you think has a major flaw. You're more likely to:"

○ (A) Point out the issue directly so it gets addressed
○ (B) Ask questions that help them discover the flaw on their own

**Why This Question:**
- Reveals communication directness in intellectually charged situations
- Tests balance between efficiency and relational care
- Socratic vs. direct feedback styles both valid in professional contexts
- Complements Q1 by testing assertiveness in peer (not leadership) context

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **OPAI Q2:** Focuses on missed deadlines (adds conflict/performance management confound)
- **GEM Q6:** Too focused on senior leadership context (not universally applicable)

---

### Q3: Proactive Leadership [Likert Scale]

**Source:** OPAI Q3 | **Signal Strength:** 7/10

"How often do you volunteer to lead discussions when a group seems uncertain about next steps?"

Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Always

**Why This Question:**
- Measures proactive vs. reactive assertiveness
- Likert format captures frequency patterns (not just single-instance preferences)
- Complements forced-choice questions with granular measurement
- Low social desirability (both high and low frequencies have valid rationales)

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q3 (reverse-coded):** "Let others set agenda" — reverse coding adds cognitive load
- **ANT Q4:** Negotiation scenario overlaps with risk tolerance questions
- **GEM Q14:** Deadline negotiation overlaps with people/task orientation

---

---

## 2. PACE PREFERENCE (3 questions)

Measures bias toward action vs. deliberation, comfort with ambiguity, and natural tempo.

---

### Q4: Launch vs. Analyze [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** OPAI Q5 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"When starting a new initiative, you're more likely to:"

○ (A) Launch a rough version quickly and refine based on feedback
○ (B) Analyze risks and edge cases before taking visible action

**Why This Question:**
- Cleanest bias-toward-action vs. deliberation trade-off in the entire set
- Directly applicable to product development and strategic execution
- Both options professionally defensible (fast iteration vs. risk management)
- High correlation with actual workplace behavior patterns

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q5:** Similar but uses "unclear requirements" framing (less universal)
- **GEM Q13:** "Version 0.1 vs 1.0" overlaps but less clean trade-off

---

### Q5: Decision Pace Under Ambiguity [Likert Scale]

**Source:** OPAI Q6 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"When facing ambiguity, I feel energized by moving fast and figuring things out along the way."

Not at all like me / Slightly like me / Moderately like me / Very much like me / Extremely like me

**Why This Question:**
- Measures emotional response to pace (not just behavior)
- "Energized" reveals intrinsic motivation vs. learned behavior
- Captures pace preference specifically in ambiguous contexts (high signal scenario)
- Likert format allows nuanced self-assessment

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q5 (reverse-coded):** Adds unnecessary cognitive load
- **ANT Q9:** "Good decision today vs great decision next week" — too abstract/hypothetical

---

### Q6: Productivity Rhythm [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** GEM Q2 | **Signal Strength:** 7/10

"In your daily workflow, you feel most productive when:"

○ (A) You have a high volume of varied tasks to knock out in rapid succession
○ (B) You have large blocks of uninterrupted time to go deep into a single complex problem

**Why This Question:**
- Reveals natural productivity rhythm (sprint vs. marathon)
- Orthogonal to strategic pace (Q4-Q5) — measures execution tempo
- Strong predictor of preferred work environment and role fit
- Both options signal competence in different professional contexts

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q7:** "Action items assigned immediately" — too dependent on meeting culture
- **ANT Q8:** Feedback response scenario overlaps with emotional regulation

---

---

## 3. PEOPLE VS. TASK ORIENTATION (3 questions)

Measures prioritization of relationships vs. outcomes, and emotional vs. functional focus.

---

### Q7: Team Behind Schedule [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** ANT Q10 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"You're leading a project that's behind schedule. You're more likely to:"

○ (A) Restructure the timeline and cut scope to hit the deadline
○ (B) Check in with the team to understand what's slowing them down before changing the plan

**Why This Question:**
- High-stakes scenario that forces genuine priority revelation
- Cleanest task-focus vs. people-focus trade-off in the entire set
- Both options are defensible leadership responses (not obviously "good" vs "bad")
- Directly applicable to real project management situations

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **OPAI Q9:** Similar construct but less balanced (B option sounds obviously better)
- **GEM Q3:** Underperformance scenario adds performance management confound

---

### Q8: Feedback Delivery Style [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** OPAI Q11 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"When giving feedback, you usually:"

○ (A) Prioritize clarity and directness
○ (B) Prioritize how the message will land emotionally

**Why This Question:**
- Pure people/task orientation without confounding variables
- Applicable to all professional levels (no hierarchy assumptions)
- Reveals core communication philosophy
- Both priorities are valid in modern management theory

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q13:** Similar but more verbose and adds "feeling about work" context
- **GEM Q7:** Focuses on "accuracy vs. morale" which adds ethical dimension

---

### Q9: 1:1 Meeting Depth [Likert Scale]

**Source:** OPAI Q10 | **Signal Strength:** 7/10

"During 1:1 meetings, I naturally spend time understanding the person beyond the task at hand."

Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Always

**Why This Question:**
- Measures frequency of relational investment (not single-instance preference)
- "Naturally" captures intrinsic tendency (not learned behavior)
- Specific to 1:1 context (removes group dynamics confound)
- Complements forced-choice questions with granular data

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q11:** "Disengaged performer" scenario overlaps with leadership style
- **GEM Q12:** "Delivered product vs. high-performing team" — too binary/extreme
- **ANT Q12 (reverse-coded):** Small talk frustration adds cognitive load

---

---

## 4. STRUCTURE PREFERENCE (3 questions)

Measures comfort with planning, systems creation, and structured vs. emergent approaches.

---

### Q10: Planning Approach [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** ANT Q15 | **Signal Strength:** 9/10

"When planning a complex initiative, you prefer to:"

○ (A) Define a rough direction and adapt as you learn more
○ (B) Build a detailed roadmap with milestones and dependencies

**Why This Question:**
- Highest-signal structure question across all three sources
- Directly applicable to strategic planning and project management
- Both approaches are professionally defensible and context-dependent
- Cleanly separates emergent vs. structured planning styles

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **GEM Q4:** "Start of work week" — too low-stakes, easily influenced by role demands
- **OPAI Q13:** Similar but less specific about planning context

---

### Q11: Systems Creation [Likert Scale]

**Source:** GEM Q8 | **Signal Strength:** 8/10

"I find it easy to 'standardize' my recurring tasks by creating checklists, templates, or automated workflows."

Scale: 1 (Never) — 5 (Always)

**Why This Question:**
- Measures operationalization capability (unique construct not in other questions)
- "Find it easy" reveals natural tendency vs. forced discipline
- Concrete examples (checklists, templates, automation) reduce ambiguity
- High predictive value for role fit (operations vs. creative roles)

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **ANT Q16:** "How often do you create written plans" — too similar to Q10
- **GEM Q11:** "Minimize surprises vs. maximize opportunity" — less actionable

---

### Q12: Comfort with Unstructured Time [Forced-Choice]

**Source:** ANT Q14 | **Signal Strength:** 7/10

"Your calendar for next week is completely empty. You feel:"

○ (A) Excited — you'll figure out priorities as they come
○ (B) Uneasy — you'd rather block time for your key goals now

**Why This Question:**
- Emotional response reveals true preference (not learned behavior)
- Concrete scenario that's universally relatable
- Both responses are professionally valid (flexibility vs. intentionality)
- Complements Q10-Q11 by focusing on personal work rhythm vs. team planning

**Eliminated Alternatives:**
- **OPAI Q15:** "Loosely structured vs tightly scheduled day" — overlaps but less specific
- **GEM Q4:** Similar but less emotionally revealing
