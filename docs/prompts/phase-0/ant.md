## LAYER 3: RISK & DECISION ARCHITECTURE

**Q17 [Scenario — Sunk Cost Bias]**
"You've spent 4 months and $30K of budget building an internal tool your team was excited about. After launch, adoption is at 15% — most people quietly went back to the old process. Your engineering lead believes two more sprints could fix the UX issues. Meanwhile, a teammate flags a well-reviewed off-the-shelf tool that costs $500/month and covers 80% of your use case. You:"

○ (A) Invest the two sprints — your team built this with specific workflows in mind, and the learnings from V1 make V2 much stronger
○ (B) Run both side by side for two weeks and let usage data decide
○ (C) Switch to the off-the-shelf tool and redeploy engineering time to higher-impact work
○ (D) Survey the team to understand why adoption was low before committing to either path

**Q18 [Confidence Calibration — follows Q17]**
"How confident are you that your answer to the previous question is the best course of action?"
— 1 (Not confident at all) → 10 (Extremely confident)

**Q19 [Scenario — Sunk Cost Bias]**
"You've been pursuing a strategic partnership for 6 months. You've had 12 meetings, built a custom demo, and involved your CEO in two calls. The partner keeps expressing interest but delays signing. A new potential partner reaches out proactively — smaller company, but they're ready to start immediately. You:"

○ (A) Stay focused on the original partner — you're too deep in to walk away, and the bigger deal is worth the wait
○ (B) Pursue both simultaneously, even though it'll stretch your team thin
○ (C) Set a two-week deadline for the original partner and shift focus to the new one if they don't commit
○ (D) Drop the original partner and go all-in on the new opportunity — momentum matters more than size

**Q20 [Risk Trade-off — Financial Risk Tolerance]**
"You're choosing between two compensation packages at companies you're equally excited about:"

○ Company A: $160K base salary, standard benefits, predictable 3-5% annual raises
○ Company B: $115K base salary + equity stake. If the company hits its targets (which leadership believes is likely), your equity could be worth $200K-$400K in 3-4 years. If it doesn't, the equity is worth nothing.

"Which do you choose?"

**Q21 [Risk Trade-off — Career/Reputational Risk Tolerance]**
"You have two options for your next career move:"

○ Path A: Senior role at a respected company in your field. Clear promotion track. You'll be very good at this job but probably won't learn much new.
○ Path B: Lateral move into a new function you're curious about. Steep learning curve — you'll be mediocre for at least a year, and some peers may see it as a step backward. But it opens a completely different long-term trajectory.

"Which do you choose?"

**Q22 [Scenario — Analytical vs. Intuitive Decision-Making]**
"Your team needs to choose a technical architecture for a new product. You have two weeks before the decision locks in. You have strong intuition about which approach is best based on past experience, but no data specific to this situation. A junior engineer proposes spending the two weeks building quick prototypes of both options to compare performance. You:"

○ (A) Go with your intuition — you've seen this pattern before, and prototyping both wastes valuable build time
○ (B) Support the prototyping — data should override gut feel on decisions this consequential
○ (C) Prototype only the approach you're less sure about to validate or rule it out
○ (D) Bring in an outside expert for a second opinion and decide based on that conversation

**Q23 [Scenario — Analytical vs. Intuitive + Confidence]**
"You're evaluating whether to enter a new market segment. Your data analysis shows modest but positive indicators — the opportunity looks reasonable but not a slam dunk. However, three customers you deeply respect have independently told you this segment is 'where everything is heading.' You:"

○ (A) Trust the customer signal — pattern recognition from smart people in the market is hard to quantify but often right
○ (B) Invest in a deeper quantitative analysis before making a commitment
○ (C) Run a small, time-boxed pilot to generate your own data
○ (D) Weigh both inputs equally and go with whichever direction they converge on

**Q24 [Confidence Calibration — follows Q23]**
"How confident are you that your answer to the previous question is the best course of action?"
— 1 (Not confident at all) → 10 (Extremely confident)

**Q25 [Scenario — Loss Aversion]**
"You run a profitable product line generating $500K annually. A market shift is happening slowly — your product will likely remain viable for 2-3 more years but is clearly declining. You have an idea for a next-generation product, but building it would require diverting 60% of your current product's engineering team for 12 months, which would accelerate the existing product's decline. You:"

○ (A) Protect the existing revenue — $500K/year is real money, and the new product is unproven. Ride the current product as long as possible.
○ (B) Start the new product with a small skunkworks team (20% of resources) to validate it without risking the cash cow
○ (C) Make the full investment shift now — waiting means entering the next market late
○ (D) Hire a separate team for the new product so you don't cannibalize the existing one

**Q26 [Scenario — Overconfidence / Anchoring]**
"You're forecasting revenue for next quarter. Last quarter you hit $1.2M, which was 10% above your forecast. Your sales pipeline looks similar to last quarter, but you've also launched into a new channel you haven't tested yet. Your leadership team asks for your forecast. You:"

○ (A) Forecast $1.3M — last quarter's outperformance plus the new channel should push you higher
○ (B) Forecast $1.2M — match last quarter since the pipeline looks similar and the new channel is unproven
○ (C) Forecast $1.05M — build in a conservative buffer since you have a new untested variable
○ (D) Provide a range ($1.0M–$1.4M) with your confidence level for each scenario

**Cross-layer insight potential examples:**
- High assertiveness (Q1-A, Q2-A) + loss-averse (Q25-A/B) → "You're decisive in meetings but protective of what you've built — you push hard on new ideas but struggle to let go of existing ones"
- Fast pace (Q5-A, Q9-agree) + intuitive decision-maker (Q22-A, Q23-A) → "You trust your pattern recognition and move quickly — this is a superpower until you're in unfamiliar territory where your patterns don't apply"
- Relationship-oriented (Q10-B, Q11-B) + sunk-cost susceptible (Q17-A, Q19-A) → "You invest deeply in people and projects, which builds loyalty — but you may hold on to underperforming initiatives because of the human investment, not the business case"
