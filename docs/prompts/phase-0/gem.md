Which do you choose?"
○ (A) Company A
○ (B) Company B

**Q19 [Scenario - Loss Aversion]**

  Do you take the bet?"
  ○ (A) Yes
  ○ (B) No

**Q22 [Scenario - Sunk Cost / Professional Persistence]**

○ (A) Finish the project as planned to secure the completion bonus.
○ (B) Recommend cancelling the project now to save the remaining 20% of the budget for better ideas.

**Q23 [Confidence Calibration]**
"On a scale of 1–10, how confident are you in your ability to accurately estimate the ROI of a project before it starts?"

○ (A) Trust your data-driven projections and stick to the 9-month plan.
○ (B) Split the difference and re-forecast for 15 months.
