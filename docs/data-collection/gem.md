This is a comprehensive foundation. The **"Growth OS"** positioning is the clear winner because it transforms a one-off "test" into a persistent "infrastructure."

To collect data effectively for a service that prides itself on **Synthesis** and **Decision Architecture**, we need to move away from the "100-question Likert scale" (1-5) slog that leads to user fatigue.

Here is a brainstorm on how to collect high-signal data across your 7 layers:

---

## 1. The "Progressive Disclosure" Strategy

Don't ask for everything upfront. Use a **modular onboarding** flow that builds the "Living Profile" in stages.

* **The Hook (The "Lead Magnet"):** A 2-minute "High-Level Archetype" quiz (Layer 1) to give immediate value.
* **The Deep Dives:** Unlock Layers 2-6 over the first week through daily "Micro-Assessments."
* **The Trigger:** Use "Contextual Prompts." If a user tells the AI Coach, *"I have a stressful meeting,"* the system says, *"To give better advice, I need to know your Conflict Style—take this 3-minute survey."*

---

## 2. Interactive Collection Methods (Beyond "1 to 5")

Standard surveys are prone to "Social Desirability Bias" (people answering as who they *want* to be). We should use:

### A. Forced-Choice (Ipsative) Pairs

Instead of "Are you a leader?", ask: *"In a crisis, are you more concerned with **A) The Speed of the Solution** or **B) The Stability of the Team**?"*

* **Value:** It forces a trade-off, revealing true priorities (Layer 2 & 5).

### B. Scenario-Based "Simulations"

Present a mini-case study: *"You have $10k. A project has a 60% chance of 5x return and 40% chance of total loss. Do you invest?"*

* **Value:** This collects cleaner data for **Layer 3 (Risk)** than a self-report ever could.

### C. The "Blindspot" Pulse (Layer 7)

* **The Mechanism:** The user enters 3 emails/phone numbers. The platform sends a "Tinder-style" swipe interface to the friends: *"Is [Name] more likely to: A) Start a fight to be right, or B) Stay silent to keep peace?"*
* **Value:** High engagement, viral loop, and provides the "Delta" for the synthesis.

### D. Gamified "Reaction" Tests

Simple UI games (e.g., clicking symbols under time pressure or "The Marshmallow Test" digital equivalent).

* **Value:** Measures **Layer 4 (Execution & Consistency)** by tracking focus decay and impulse control.

## 3. Passive & Behavioral Data (The "Growth OS" Edge)

If we want to be an "OS," we should eventually pull data from where the user actually "lives":

* **Calendar Integration (Optional/Premium):** Analyze meeting density vs. "Focus Time." (e.g., *"You say you value Mastery, but 90% of your week is spent in 'Conventional' administrative meetings."*)
* **Writing Style Analysis:** If the user interacts with the AI Coach, use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect sentiment, assertiveness, or cognitive biases in their prose.

## 4. Data Structure: The "Profile MCP" Schema

Since we are building for an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** future, our data collection must be structured for machine readability.

| Data Point Type | Collection Method | Storage Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Traits** | Psychometric Surveys | Vectorized Scores ( to ) |
| **Narrative** | AI Coaching Transcripts | Key-Value Tags (e.g., `fear_pattern: "rejection"`) |
| **Peer Delta** | Layer 7 Surveys | Divergence Coefficients |
| **Context** | User Profile Settings | Environment Tags (e.g., `work_env: "high-growth startup"`) |

---

## 5. The "Anti-Fatigue" UI/UX

To keep users from dropping off during the 7-layer journey:

* **Progress Visualization:** A "Brain Map" that lights up or gains "resolution" as more data is provided.
* **"Earned" Insights:** *"You've answered 10 questions. We've identified your #1 Decision Bias. Want to see it now or finish the set for a full report?"*
* **Streaks & Rewards:** Small psychological rewards for completing the "Daily Diagnostic."

### High-Value Next Step

Since we’ve mapped out the *how*, would you like me to **draft the specific questions/scenarios for the Phase 1 "Lead Magnet" (Layer 1 + Layer 3)?** We could design the first 10 questions a user would see to get hooked.
