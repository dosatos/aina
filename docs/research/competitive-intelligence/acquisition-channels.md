## Key Takeaways

### What Works for User Acquisition:
1. **Freemium as standard**: Free test is table stakes, not differentiator
2. **Social proof at scale**: Display massive user numbers prominently
3. **Low-friction entry**: No registration required upfront
4. **Shareable results**: Design for virality through identity-based outcomes
5. **Content marketing**: SEO-optimized educational content drives organic traffic
6. **Multi-framework approach**: Capture users across different personality systems
7. **B2B virality**: Team assessments create workplace adoption loops

### What Kills Growth:
1. **Hidden pricing**: Subscription traps destroy trust and create negative reviews
2. **Poor customer service**: Unresponsive support drives negative word-of-mouth
3. **Access issues**: Expired links and delivery failures frustrate users
4. **Aggressive policies**: Blacklisting customers who return products

### Critical Success Factors:
- **Trust is paramount**: Users share personal psychological data
- **Value delivery before capture**: Show worth before asking for email/payment
- **Emotional resonance**: Results must feel accurate and meaningful
- **Shareability by design**: Results format must facilitate social discussion

## Data Gaps & Further Research Needed

**Missing Verified Data:**

- Viral coefficient (K-factor) for social sharing
- Specific A/B test results and learnings
- Detailed affiliate program performance
- Return visitor rates and frequency

**Note**: Most platforms do not publicly disclose performance metrics. The data presented represents observable tactics and publicly available information only.
