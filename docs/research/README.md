# Research Documentation

**Last Updated:** February 18, 2026
**Version:** 1.1 (Precision improvements applied)

This folder contains comprehensive B2C persona research based on publicly available web sources.

## Recent Updates (v1.1)

**Precision improvements applied throughout:**
- ✓ Clarified "61% problem-solving" → "61% spend 30+ min daily **searching for solutions**" (Googling, Stack Overflow, docs)
- ✓ Added scope warnings: Developer behavior data ≠ all career pivoters (PMs, consultants, designers unverified)
- ✓ Separated Stack Overflow data (developers only) from PwC data (broader tech sector)
- ✓ Added interpretation notes explaining what statistics actually measure and why they matter
- ✓ Flagged job role assumptions (PM, designer, consultant behaviors extrapolated from developer data)
- ✓ Improved "VERIFIED vs. INFERRED vs. HYPOTHESIS" precision throughout

---

## Quick Start

**Read this first:** `00-MASTER-SYNTHESIS.md`

This master document synthesizes all findings with clear separation between:
- ✓ **VERIFIED data** (with sources)
- ⚠️ **INFERRED data** (evidence-based but requiring validation)
- ❌ **HYPOTHESES** (assumptions requiring testing)

## Key Findings Summary

### Strongest Verified Data

**Age:** 25-34 = 41% of market (strongest demographic signal)
**Career Change:** Average 39 years old, 4.1 years per job, 12 jobs in lifetime
**Motivations:** Higher pay (63%), burnout (45%), meaningful work (71%)
**Willingness to Pay:** $29 one-time accepted, $50-300/hour for coaching
**What Works:** Accuracy, 10-min completion, free+premium model, shareability
**What Fails:** Hidden subscriptions, poor support, deceptive pricing

### Biggest Data Gaps

❌ Gender distribution (not publicly available)
❌ Precise income brackets (inferred from spending behavior)
❌ Conversion rates (competitors don't publish)
❌ Media consumption patterns (inferred)
❌ Detailed psychographics (requires interviews)

## What's Missing (Requires Primary Research)

### Critical Gaps Requiring User Interviews:
1. Gender distribution
2. Precise income brackets
3. Education level percentages
4. Psychographic depth (values, fears, aspirations)
5. Media consumption specifics
6. Pain point intensity ranking
7. Decision trigger prioritization
8. Objection phrasing
9. Actual willingness to pay (stated vs. revealed preference)

### Alternative Data Collection Methods:
- LinkedIn Ads audience insights (reverse engineer demographics)
- Google Trends (search pattern analysis)
- Reddit surveys (r/mbti, r/personalitytests)
- Purchase market reports ($2K-$5K from Statista, IBISWorld)
- Partner with academic psychology departments
- Facebook/LinkedIn ad targeting experiments

## Research Principles Applied

### What This Research Does:
✓ Separates verified facts from inferences
✓ Cites sources with URLs and dates
✓ Documents data gaps explicitly
✓ Provides actionable validation plan
✓ Offers hypothesis-driven framework

### What This Research Does NOT Do:
❌ Make up statistics
❌ Present assumptions as facts
❌ Claim certainty where none exists
❌ Overgeneralize from limited data
❌ Ignore contradictory evidence

---

## Next Steps (Phase 0 Validation)

1. **Recruit 20-30 people** matching primary persona
2. **Deploy Google Form MVP** (30 questions)
3. **Conduct 10-15 behavioral interviews**
4. **Measure actual behavior:** completion, sharing, peer invites
5. **Validate/invalidate hypotheses** systematically
6. **Iterate personas** based on real behavior
7. **Update this research** with findings
