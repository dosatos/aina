# B2C Persona Research - Master Synthesis
**Research Date:** February 17, 2026
**Status:** Based on public web research (9 research documents, 50+ sources attempted, ~15 accessible)

---

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes verified research findings into actionable B2C personas. It explicitly separates **VERIFIED DATA** (with sources) from **HYPOTHESES** (inferences requiring validation).

**Critical Finding:** Comprehensive demographic data about personality test users is surprisingly scarce in public sources. Most detailed reports are behind $2K-$5K paywalls. However, we gathered enough verified data to construct evidence-based personas.

## Validation Plan

### Phase 0: Manual MVP (Current Phase)

**Before building anything, validate core assumptions:**

1. **Google Form MVP** (30 questions: 15 Layer 1 + 10 Layer 3 + 5 demographic)
2. **Test with 20-30 people** matching persona (recruit via LinkedIn, founder communities)
3. **Manually generate results** using Claude/GPT-4
4. **Measure actual behavior:**
   - ✓ Completion rate (target: 70%+)
   - ✓ Time to complete (target: 15-20 min)
   - ✓ Share rate (target: 60%+)
   - ✓ Peer survey send rate (target: 40%+)
   - ✓ "I feel seen" reactions vs. "interesting but..." reactions

5. **Interview 10-15 target users:**
   - Focus on **past behavior** (not "would you")
   - "Tell me about your last big career decision - how did you make it?"
   - "Have you completed personality tests? Which? Did you share results?"
   - "What's keeping you up at night about your career?"
   - "Would you pay $X for this? Show me - complete it right now" (commitment test)

### Validation Questions by Hypothesis

**H1: Psychographic Profile**
- Ask: "What are your top 3 values in work?" (open-ended, then categorize)
- Ask: "Would you rather: [high pay safe job] vs. [lower pay meaningful job]?" (forced choice)
- Observe: Do they complete assessment during interview? (reveals intellectual honesty)

**H2: Media Consumption**
- Ask: "How did you hear about this?" (open text)
- Ask: "Where do you get career advice?" (open, then categorize)
- Survey: "Check all that apply: LinkedIn daily / Podcasts weekly / Twitter / etc."

**H3: Pain Point Ranking**
- Ask: "Of these 5 challenges, which keeps you up at night?" (forced ranking)
- Ask: "Tell me about the last time you felt stuck in your career" (behavioral)
- Observe: Which pain point makes them lean forward / get emotional?

**H4: Objections**
- Ask: "What made you hesitate to take this?" (after completion)
- Ask: "Have you tried personality tests before? What happened?"
- A/B test: Show 2 landing pages, measure which converts better

**H5: Decision Triggers**
- Ask: "What would make you pay for this?" (open-ended)
- Ask: "Would you share these results? Why/why not?"
- Observe: Do they screenshot results unprompted?

**H7-H9: Demographics**
- Survey: Age, income bracket, education, gender, job title
- Compare: Do self-reported demographics match hypotheses?

### Decision Criteria (Go/No-Go)

**Proceed to MVP build if:**
- ✅ 70%+ complete Google Form
- ✅ 60%+ share results or say they would
- ✅ 30%+ complete during interview (reveals genuine interest)
- ✅ Strong "I feel seen" reactions (not just "interesting")
- ✅ At least 40% match primary persona profile

**Pivot/iterate if:**
- ⚠️ Low completion (<50%)
- ⚠️ Nobody shares results
- ⚠️ "Interesting but wouldn't pay" reactions
- ⚠️ Wrong demographic completes (not 25-40 career-focused)

**Kill/major rethink if:**
- ❌ <30% completion
- ❌ "I don't believe in personality tests" reactions
- ❌ Zero sharing behavior
- ❌ Cannot recruit target personas

## Summary: What We Know vs. What We Assume

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (Verified with Sources)

✓ **Age:** 25-34 age group = 41% of market (strongest signal)
✓ **Career stage:** Mid-career (5-12 years), average 39 at career shift
✓ **Career change frequent:** 4.1 years per job, 12 jobs in lifetime
✓ **Motivations:** Higher pay (63%), burnout (45%), meaningful work (71%)
✓ **Developers specifically:** 84% employed, 61% spend 30+ min daily searching for solutions (Stack Overflow 2024)
✓ **Tech sector (PwC):** 71% learning new skills, 54% used AI, 55% financial strain
✓ **Willingness to pay:** $29 one-time accepted, $50-300/hour for coaching
✓ **Market size:** $48B personal development, $2.6B coaching, growing
✓ **What works:** Accuracy ("spot on"), 10-min completion, free entry, $29 premium
✓ **What fails:** Hidden subscriptions, poor support, unclear value

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Inferred from Strong Signals)

⚠️ **Income:** $80K-$200K (based on willingness to pay coaching rates)
⚠️ **Education:** Bachelor's+ (based on job titles requiring degrees)
⚠️ **Job roles beyond developers:** PM, consulting, founders share similar career stage/income but behavioral patterns unverified
⚠️ **Pain intensity ranking:** Career misalignment > decision paralysis > interpersonal friction (need forced-rank validation)
⚠️ **Decision triggers:** ROI, social proof, specificity, design quality (inferred from review analysis)

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Most behavioral data (61% search daily, 54% use AI, 42% hybrid) is from Stack Overflow developer survey. Generalizability to PMs, designers, consultants is **unverified assumption** requiring validation.

### LOW CONFIDENCE (Assumptions Requiring Validation)

❌ **Gender split:** Unknown (no public data)
❌ **Psychographic details:** Values, fears, identity aspirations (need interviews)
❌ **Media consumption:** LinkedIn daily, podcasts 3-5hrs/week (assumed)
❌ **Specific objections:** "Just another MBTI" etc. (need user interviews)
❌ **"Analytical Self-Optimizer" persona:** Existence/size unknown

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Recruit 20-30 people** matching primary persona for Phase 0 validation
2. **Deploy Google Form MVP** with 30 questions
3. **Conduct 10-15 behavioral interviews** (focus on past actions, not hypothetical interest)
4. **Measure actual behavior:** Completion, sharing, peer invites, payment intent
5. **Validate/invalidate hypotheses** systematically
6. **Iterate persona** based on who actually completes and shares
7. **Document learnings** before spending 8+ weeks building

**The real persona emerges from behavior, not surveys.** These profiles are educated starting points - validation will refine or invalidate them.

## Key Takeaway

We have **enough verified data** to construct evidence-based personas and a validation plan, but **significant gaps remain** that only primary research (interviews, surveys, MVP testing) can fill. The hypothesis-driven approach allows us to test assumptions systematically before committing to full product development.

**The opportunity:** Competitors likely don't have better demographic data either (it's not publicly available). Direct user research becomes a competitive advantage, not just a validation step.
