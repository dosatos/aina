# Marketing & Growth Strategy

A combined reference synthesizing ideas from three independent brainstorm sessions (`docs/marketing/`).

---

## 1. Strategic Foundation

### What We're Marketing

We are not marketing a test, a dashboard, or a PDF. We are marketing:

> "A truth about yourself you can't unsee."

The core marketing insight: **self-knowledge is inherently shareable.** People love talking about themselves. Every personality platform that's ever taken off — 16Personalities, Enneagram, even BuzzFeed quizzes — grew because people *wanted* to share their results. That's the engine we're building on top of.

But we're not just a fun quiz — we're a professional tool. The strategy must balance virality with credibility. Too fun and we're another BuzzFeed quiz. Too serious and nobody shares anything.

### Psychological Triggers

The marketing should deliberately activate:

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Curiosity** | The blindspot gap — what don't you know about yourself? | "Most founders overestimate one trait. Do you?" |
| **Ego** | People want to see themselves reflected back | "You rank higher than 63% in execution." |
| **Identity** | Labels people want to claim | "The Strategic Maverick" |
| **Comparison** | Where do I fall relative to others? | "Only 7% score high on calibrated risk." |
| **Growth** | Seeing change over time | "Your risk profile shifted after your career move." |
| **Social proof** | Others like me use this | "Used by 4,200 engineers." |

## 2. Positioning & Narrative

### Language That Elevates

Use:
- "Build your personal operating system."
- "Audit your decision architecture."
- "Find the gap between who you think you are and who you are."

Avoid:
- "Take this test."
- "Personality quiz."
- "Find your type."

The product should feel like **infrastructure for self-knowledge**, not a one-time assessment.

### Shareable Archetypes

Create memorable, identity-worthy labels that synthesize cross-layer data:
- "The High-Velocity Builder"
- "The Strategic Contrarian"
- "The Controlled Risk-Taker"
- "The Analytical Firestarter"

These must be:
- Visually strong (designed as shareable cards)
- Socially desirable (people *want* to claim them)
- Substantive (backed by real assessment data, not just a fun label)

### Niche-First Approach

Start narrow, expand later:

**Primary niche:** Engineers, founders, analytical professionals
**Positioning for this niche:** "System Design for Yourself."
**Tone:** Analytical, serious, no fluff — matches how this audience already thinks

Mass market can come later. Niche credibility is the foundation.

## 3. Growth Loops (Built Into the Product)

These aren't marketing campaigns — they're mechanics embedded in the product that generate growth as a *byproduct* of usage.

### The Peer Survey Viral Loop

The single most powerful growth mechanism. Every user who completes their profile is prompted to send a short survey to 3-5 people. Each respondent interacts with the platform, sees a teaser insight, and gets invited to build their own profile.

**The math:** If each user invites 4 people and 25% convert to taking their own assessment, that's a 1.0 viral coefficient — every user brings one new user. Above 1.0 = organic exponential growth.

**The key:** Don't just ask respondents boring questions. At the end, show them a micro-insight about *their own* tendencies based on how they answered: *"Based on your responses, you might lean toward [X] in conflict situations. Want to find out more?"* That curiosity gap is the conversion moment.

### Share-Your-Profile Cards

After getting results, users can share a beautiful, visual card — think Spotify Wrapped but for behavioral insights. Not the full report (that's behind the paywall), but a compelling snapshot:

> *"My top behavioral pattern: The Strategic Maverick — high drive, high risk tolerance, low patience for process."*

Design considerations:
- A card, not a wall of text
- Beautiful enough that sharing it is a flex, not cringe
- Platform-specific variants: polished for LinkedIn, playful for Instagram/TikTok

### The "How to Work With Me" Manual

Users generate a one-pager they can share with teammates, managers, or partners. This is useful *and* introduces the platform to every person who receives it. It positions the product as a practical communication tool, not just a self-indulgent quiz.

### The Unlock Sequence

As users complete more layers, they unlock deeper cross-layer insights. This creates natural progression: *"You've completed 3 of 7 layers. Complete Layer 4 to unlock your Execution-Risk pattern."* The reward is self-knowledge, not badges — gamification without feeling gimmicky.

---

## 4. Content Strategy

### A) Data-Driven Insight Reports

The assessment data (anonymized, aggregated) is a content goldmine. Once we have enough users, publish findings like:

- "We analyzed 10,000 risk profiles — here's how founders differ from corporate managers."
- "The most common blindspot among senior leaders."
- "73% of people overestimate their openness to feedback."
- "Founders overestimate their risk tolerance by 32%."

This demonstrates platform depth, builds SEO, positions us as a thought leader, and is inherently shareable. Design for social distribution — data visualizations, surprising findings, counterintuitive insights.

### B) "Guess Before You Test" Format

Interactive social content where people predict their own results before taking the assessment: *"Do you think you're more risk-tolerant or risk-averse? Most people get this wrong about themselves."*

Taps into the curiosity gap AND the self-perception gap. Works as Instagram polls, X threads, TikTok videos, LinkedIn carousels — every piece funnels to "Take the actual assessment to find out."

### C) Scenario Content

Turn assessment questions into viral polls:

- "Would you leave a $150k job for 40% equity?"
- "Your project is failing at month 3. A new opportunity appears. What do you do?"

These work as standalone social content AND demonstrate what the platform actually does.

### D) Micro-Insight Content

Short, sharp cross-layer observations that serve as hooks:

- "High risk tolerance + low execution = idea graveyard."
- "Avoidant in conflict but dominant in decisions? That's selective courage."
- "You say you value mastery, but 90% of your week is meetings."

### E) SEO / Long-Tail Content

People actively search for: "am I in the right career," "how to know my strengths," "why do I avoid conflict," "personality test for leadership." These are high-intent queries from exactly our target audience.

Build a content library that answers these questions substantively and leads to "Take our assessment to get a personalized answer." The Layer structure maps to content pillars:

| Content Pillar | Layer | Example Topics |
|---|---|---|
| Risk & Decision-Making | Layer 3 | "The Cognitive Biases of SaaS Founders," "Are You Risk-Tolerant or Just Impulsive?" |
| Conflict & Relationships | Layer 5 | "How a High-Dominance Manager Can Give Feedback to a Conflict-Avoidant Employee" |
| Career Alignment | Layer 6 | "Why Your DISC Type Is Lying to You About Your Risk Tolerance" |
| Execution & Follow-Through | Layer 4 | "The Execution Gap in Mid-Career Engineers" |

### F) GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

In 2026, people increasingly ask AI assistants for career and behavioral advice. Publish structured "Interaction Case Studies" and research that AI models can cite. When users ask Claude or ChatGPT *"How do I deal with my boss?"*, our structured research on relational styles becomes the source material the AI cites.

### G) Newsletter

Weekly or biweekly — one insight, one data point, one reflection prompt. Keep it short. The newsletter serves retention (bringing users back to try a new layer) and acquisition (shareable enough that subscribers forward it). Every email is a tiny moment of self-reflection that reinforces the platform's value.

---

## 5. Channel Strategy

### LinkedIn — Primary Channel

For the career-oriented 25-40 audience, LinkedIn is where they already think about professional growth.

**Content types that work:**
- Data-driven insights from the platform
- Personal reflection posts from founders/users sharing what they learned
- "How to Work With Me" cards that users share
- Thought leadership on self-awareness in the workplace

Also serves as a B2B lead gen channel — content that resonates with HR leaders, L&D professionals, and team managers who might bring the platform to their organizations.

### TikTok / Instagram Reels — Awareness & Virality

Top-of-funnel awareness play. Lighter, more personal tone than LinkedIn.

**Content examples:**
- "I took a cognitive bias test and found out I hold onto failing projects 40% longer than I should"
- Quick breakdowns of behavioral types
- "Which risk profile are you?" interactive hooks
- Before/after stories of blindspot discoveries

### Podcasts — Both Hosting and Guesting

Self-improvement and career podcasts are a massive category.

**Two approaches:**
1. Guest on existing shows — founders sharing the story, interesting data, the science of self-awareness
2. Eventually host our own show — interviewing people about their profiles, blindspots, and pivots

Podcast audiences are high-trust and high-engagement — ideal for a product that requires vulnerability.

### Twitter/X — Philosophical Edge

Sharp, philosophical micro-insights. Best for building intellectual credibility and reaching the analytical/founder audience.

### Email — Insight Teasers, Not "We Miss You"

When a user completes Layer 1 but drops off, don't send a generic re-engagement email. Instead, send an **insight teaser**: *"Based on your Behavioral Style, we've predicted your #1 barrier to execution. Unlock Layer 4 to see if we're right."*

---

## 6. Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch: Build a Waitlist With a Micro-Experience

Don't just put up a "coming soon" page. Create a standalone micro-assessment — a 5-question risk profile quiz — that gives people a teaser result and puts them on the waitlist.

*"You're in the top 15% for career risk tolerance but bottom 30% for financial risk. Want the full picture? Join the waitlist."*

This proves the concept, collects emails, and gives people something to share before the product even launches.

### Launch: The "1,000 Founding Profiles" Campaign

Set a public goal: *"We're building the world's first cross-assessment behavioral platform and we need 1,000 founding profiles to calibrate our AI."*

Founding users get lifetime free access to the premium tier. This creates urgency, makes early users feel like participants rather than customers, and provides a normative dataset to benchmark against.

### Post-Launch: The Data Reveals

Once we hit a meaningful sample size, start publishing aggregate insights: *"Our first 5,000 users revealed that 73% of people overestimate their openness to feedback."* This turns the user base into content, creates press opportunities, and reinforces that the platform is doing something no one else does.

## 7. Partnership & Distribution

### Coaching & Therapy Integration

Thousands of executive coaches, career coaches, therapists, and counselors would love a structured assessment tool for clients. Give coaches a free professional account, let them send assessments to clients, make the experience branded to the coach but powered by our platform. Each coach becomes a distribution channel.

### Accelerator & MBA Program Partnerships

Startup accelerators and MBA programs care deeply about self-awareness, leadership, and team dynamics. Offer a free cohort assessment: *"Every founder in your cohort gets a full profile, plus a team compatibility analysis."*

This seeds the product with high-influence early adopters — founders talk to other founders, MBA students become corporate buyers later.

### B2B / HR & L&D

Position the platform as a team development tool — not just individual assessments but team composition analysis: *"Your team has 4 high-dominance profiles and zero high-empathy profiles — here's why your meetings feel combative."*

Harder sell (longer sales cycle, procurement processes) but dramatically higher revenue per customer.

### Integration Partnerships

Integrate with tools people already use: Slack (share your "Working With Me" card in your profile), Notion (embed your profile in your personal wiki), LinkedIn (profile badge or card), and the MCP server for AI tools. Each integration is both a feature and a distribution channel.

### Compatibility Tools

A "Founders' Pre-flight" feature where two people take an abbreviated version of Layers 1, 3, and 5 and compare alignment. Useful for co-founder matching, team formation, or hiring alignment checks. This serves as a standalone B2B hook.

---

## 8. Retention & Re-engagement

Most personality platforms are one-and-done. The Growth OS model requires stickiness.

### 6-Month Retake

Prompt users to retake every 6 months. Frame it as growth tracking, not repetition: *"It's been 6 months — let's see how you've evolved."* Show the delta. This is a natural re-engagement trigger and feeds the Growth OS vision.

### "Someone Took Your Survey" Notifications

Every time a peer completes the survey, send a notification: *"A new response is in — your Blindspot profile has been updated."* This brings people back and creates anticipation. Stagger the reveal if multiple peers respond.

### Behavioral Streaks

Track sprint completions, reflection logs, and bias detection improvement. Gamify progress without making it feel trivial.

### AI Coach Nudges

Personalized weekly prompts based on the user's profile: *"Based on your conflict style, you may avoid today's difficult conversation. Here's a reframe."* Feels personalized because it *is* personalized.

### Insight Teaser Re-engagement

Instead of generic "come back" emails, predict something specific: *"Based on your Behavioral Style, we predicted your #1 execution barrier. Unlock Layer 4 to see if we're right."*

### Layer Unlock Sequence

More layers completed = richer cross-layer patterns unlocked. The incomplete profile visualization itself motivates completion — the "collect them all" dynamic driven by genuine curiosity, not artificial badges.

## 9. Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Completion rate** | % who finish an assessment they start | 70%+ |
| **Peer survey send rate** | % of users who invite peers | The viral engine — monitor closely |
| **Peer survey conversion rate** | % of respondents who create own profile | 25%+ for 1.0 viral coefficient |
| **Share rate** | % who share results on social | Track by platform |
| **Layer depth** | Average layers completed per user | Correlates with retention + willingness to pay |
| **Retake rate** | % who return at 6 months | Measures Growth OS stickiness |

---

## 10. The #1 Strategic Priority

If there's one investment to prioritize above all else, it's making the **results experience so insightful and so beautiful that people can't help but share it.**

Not paid ads. Not SEO. Not partnerships. Those all matter, but the atomic unit of growth for this product is someone getting their results, feeling *seen*, and wanting to show someone else.

Every design dollar, every copywriting hour, every engineering sprint on the results page pays dividends across every other channel.

The Spotify Wrapped analogy is the right one. Wrapped isn't a marketing campaign — it's a product feature that *becomes* marketing. That's what we're building.
