# Overlap Analysis, Copyright Map & Generic Layer Proposal

---

## Part 1: What All Three Docs Agree On (Overlapping Ideas)

These ideas appeared in 2 or 3 of the brainstorm docs. Convergence across independent sessions signals strong ideas.

### Strong Overlap (all 3 docs)

| Idea | gem-1 | opai-1 | ant-1 | Takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cross-test synthesis is the core value** | "The Synthesis" / Meta-Analysis Engine | "Integrated Profile" / 4D profile | "Unified Profile Across Multiple Assessments" | This is the product. Everyone agrees the magic is in how tests intersect, not the tests themselves. |
| **Career pivoters as a key audience** | "The Pivoters" | Young Professionals (22-35) | Career-Oriented Professionals (25-40) | Slightly different age ranges, but the same persona: someone feeling stuck or misaligned. |
| **Founders/entrepreneurs as a segment** | Implied in "high-velocity founder type" | Segment 2: Founders/Builders | Option B: Founders & Entrepreneurs | High willingness to pay. Risk profile + leadership blind spots are the hook. |
| **AI-generated personalized reports** | AI Coach Integration | AI-Generated Narrative Report | AI-Powered Insight Layer | All three envision LLM-driven analysis as the differentiator over static PDFs. |
| **Growth tracking over time** | "Living Profile" | "Growth Over Time" (retake every 6 months) | "Progress Over Time" | Drives retention. Tracks emotional stability, risk tolerance, confidence calibration shifts. |
| **Actionable output, not just labels** | "Actionable Sprints" (7-day challenges) | "Actionable Recommendations" | "Growth Roadmap" / next steps | Everyone rejects "You are Type X" in favor of "Here's what to do about it." |
| **Freemium + premium tiers** | Not detailed | Freemium model listed | Freemium with free basics, premium behind paywall | Consensus on free entry point with paid depth. |

### Moderate Overlap (2 of 3 docs)

| Idea | Present In | Absent From |
|---|---|---|
| Behavioral style assessment (DISC/Big Five) | All mention it, but gem-1 and ant-1 give specifics | opai-1 lists dimensions but not framework names |
| Risk tolerance / "Risk-o-meter" | gem-1 (named), opai-1 (detailed 5-dimension model) | ant-1 mentions it but less emphasis |
| Cognitive bias assessment | opai-1 (full layer), ant-1 (mentioned) | gem-1 doesn't cover it |
| B2B / team use case | gem-1 (High-Performance Teams), opai-1 (Hiring/Recruiting) | ant-1 mentions B2B revenue but less as an audience |
| Peer feedback / external perspective | gem-1 ("Blindspot Check") | opai-1 mentions peer feedback in Growth OS, ant-1 doesn't propose a mechanism |
| Subscription model | opai-1, ant-1 | gem-1 doesn't discuss business model in depth |

### Unique to One Doc (no overlap)

| Idea | Source | Value |
|---|---|---|
| "Blindspot Check" (survey 3 friends) | gem-1 only | High — viral loop + unique feature |
| "Actionable Sprints" (7-day challenges) | gem-1 only | High — behavior change, not just data |
| "System Design for Yourself" (tech angle) | opai-1 only | Medium — niche but compelling for founder's background |
| Execution & Discipline layer | opai-1 only | High — most platforms ignore this entirely |
| Build vs. License strategy with costs | ant-1 only | Critical — practical legal/financial guidance |
| Coaching marketplace revenue stream | ant-1 only | Medium — additional monetization |
| White-label option | ant-1 only | Medium — B2B scalability |
| Named competitors (Crystal, Truity, etc.) | ant-1 only | Helpful — competitive awareness |

## Part 2: Copyright & Trademark Map

### Summary Table

| Framework | Trademarked Name? | Underlying Model | Can We Build Our Own? | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DISC** | "DiSC" (Wiley) is TM'd | Public domain (Marston, 1928) | Yes — dozens of providers already do | LOW |
| **CliftonStrengths (Gallup)** | Yes — all 34 theme names TM'd | Fully proprietary | No — aggressively enforced | HIGH |
| **Big Five (OCEAN)** | Not trademarked | Public domain; IPIP provides free item pool (3,329+ items) | Yes — safest foundation available | VERY LOW |
| **MBTI / 16Personalities** | "MBTI," "Myers-Briggs" TM'd | Jungian typology is public domain; MBTI instrument is proprietary | Yes for Jungian types; avoid "MBTI" name and four-letter codes (gray area) | LOW-MODERATE |
| **Enneagram** | "Enneagram Institute" marks only | Public domain (court-affirmed, 1991) | Yes — many providers already do | LOW |
| **VIA Character Strengths** | Yes — classification + survey copyrighted | Proprietary; explicitly prohibits derivative assessments | No to the 24-strength classification; yes to original character/virtue frameworks | MODERATE-HIGH |
| **Holland Codes (RIASEC)** | Not trademarked | Public domain; used by U.S. Dept of Labor (O*NET) | Yes — public domain markers exist | VERY LOW |
| **Thomas-Kilmann (TKI)** | "TKI" is TM'd | Five conflict styles are general academic concepts (Blake & Mouton, 1964) | Yes for the 5-style model; avoid "TKI" name and specific items | LOW-MODERATE |
| **Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** | Specific instruments (EQ-i, ESCI, MSCEIT) are TM'd | General concept is public domain | Yes — build original EQ framework freely | LOW |

### The Safe Foundation
**Build on these without legal concern:** Big Five (OCEAN), Holland Codes (RIASEC), DISC model (not "DiSC" brand), Enneagram, conflict styles (5-mode model), EQ concepts.

**Avoid or license:** CliftonStrengths (34 themes), VIA (24 strengths classification), MBTI instrument (use Jungian theory instead).

## Part 3: Generic Layer Proposal

Instead of referencing trademarked frameworks, here are **7 original assessment layers** — each focused on evaluating a specific aspect of a person. Each layer solves a clear problem and can be built entirely on public domain research.

---

### Layer 1: Behavioral Dynamics
**Problem it solves:** *"How do I naturally behave in social and professional settings?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Assertiveness spectrum (directive ↔ accommodating)
- Pace preference (fast/action-oriented ↔ deliberate/reflective)
- People orientation (task-focused ↔ relationship-focused)
- Structure preference (spontaneous ↔ systematic)

**Built on:** Big Five (OCEAN) via IPIP public domain items + DISC behavioral theory (Marston, 1928). Both fully public domain.

**Output example:** "You lead with directness and speed. In teams, you push for decisions quickly but may skip consensus-building — which creates friction with deliberate collaborators."

---

### Layer 2: Drive & Motivation Profile
**Problem it solves:** *"What actually drives me — and what drains me?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Core motivators: autonomy, mastery, impact, security, status, connection
- Fear patterns: what you avoid and why
- Energy sources vs. energy drains
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation balance

**Built on:** Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan — academic, not proprietary), Enneagram motivation/fear framework (public domain), general values research.

**Output example:** "You're driven by autonomy and mastery but undervalue security. You energize in creative problem-solving and drain in repetitive process work. Your fear pattern: avoiding dependence on others, which can become isolation."

---

### Layer 3: Risk & Decision Architecture
**Problem it solves:** *"How do I actually make decisions — and where am I blind?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Risk tolerance across domains (financial, career, social, reputational, intellectual)
- Cognitive bias susceptibility (confirmation bias, sunk cost, overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, authority bias)
- Decision style (analytical, intuitive, dependent, avoidant)
- Speed-accuracy tradeoff preference

**Built on:** Kahneman & Tversky's prospect theory and cognitive bias research (academic, public domain), general decision science literature.

**Output example:** "You're risk-tolerant in career moves but risk-averse financially. You over-index on intuition and under-verify with data. Your biggest blind spot: sunk cost — you hold onto failing projects 40% longer than your risk profile predicts."

---

### Layer 4: Execution & Consistency Engine
**Problem it solves:** *"Why do I start things but not finish them?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Follow-through rate (start-to-finish ratio)
- Consistency under pressure vs. comfort
- Long-term planning ability vs. reactive mode
- Setback response (bounce-back speed, adaptation vs. abandonment)
- Energy and focus management patterns

**Built on:** Conscientiousness dimension from Big Five (IPIP, public domain), grit research (Duckworth — concept is academic), self-regulation research.

**Output example:** "Your initiation energy is in the top 20%, but your follow-through drops significantly after week 3. Under pressure, you switch to reactive mode rather than sticking to plans. Your setback pattern: you reframe and restart rather than push through — innovative but expensive."

---

### Layer 5: Relational & Conflict Style
**Problem it solves:** *"How do I handle people, feedback, and disagreement?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Conflict approach (5-mode: compete, collaborate, compromise, avoid, accommodate)
- Feedback tolerance (how well you receive criticism)
- Empathy and emotional read accuracy
- Self-regulation under social stress
- Power orientation (seek control, share power, defer)

**Built on:** Blake & Mouton conflict grid (1964, public domain), Agreeableness + Neuroticism from Big Five (IPIP), general emotional intelligence research.

**Output example:** "You default to competing in conflict, switching to avoidance when stakes feel personal. You're accurate at reading others' emotions but slow to regulate your own under stress. You seek shared power in theory but centralize decisions under pressure."

---

### Layer 6: Career & Interest Alignment
**Problem it solves:** *"Am I in the right field — and what environment fits me?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Interest profile across 6 domains (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional)
- Work environment fit (structured ↔ ambiguous, solo ↔ team, stable ↔ dynamic)
- Values-career alignment score
- Burnout risk indicators

**Built on:** Holland Codes / RIASEC (public domain, O*NET-backed), general career development research, burnout research (Maslach — concept is academic).

**Output example:** "Your strongest interests are Investigative + Enterprising — you want to solve hard problems AND build something with them. Your current environment is highly Conventional, which explains the misalignment you feel. Burnout risk: moderate-high due to values mismatch, not workload."

---

### Layer 7: Self-Perception Gap (The Blindspot Layer)
**Problem it solves:** *"Do I see myself the way others see me?"*

**What it evaluates:**
- Self-rated scores on Layers 1-6 vs. peer-rated scores (via a short survey sent to 3-5 people)
- Gap analysis: where self-perception diverges from external perception
- Overestimation zones (you think you're better than others see you)
- Underestimation zones (others see strengths you don't claim)

**Built on:** Johari Window model (Luft & Ingham, 1955 — public domain), 360-degree feedback methodology (general HR practice, not proprietary).

**Output example:** "You rate yourself low on empathy, but your peers rate you in the top quartile — you're undervaluing a real strength. Conversely, you rate your consistency high, but peers see you as unpredictable. Biggest gap: you think you collaborate; others experience you as competing."

---

## How the Layers Connect (The Synthesis)

The real product value is in cross-layer patterns. Examples:

| Pattern | Layers Involved | Insight |
|---|---|---|
| High drive + low execution | Layer 2 + Layer 4 | "You start ambitiously but abandon mid-way. Your motivation is real; your systems aren't." |
| Risk-tolerant + avoids conflict | Layer 3 + Layer 5 | "You'll bet your career on a startup but won't push back in a meeting. Your risk is selective." |
| Career misalignment + high burnout risk | Layer 6 + Layer 4 | "The drain isn't the workload — it's the environment mismatch." |
| Self-perception gap + low feedback tolerance | Layer 7 + Layer 5 | "You have blind spots AND you resist the feedback that would reveal them." |
| High assertiveness + low empathy read | Layer 1 + Layer 5 | "You push hard but miss signals. People comply but don't buy in." |

## Recommended MVP Stack

For a first launch, these 3 layers give the most value with the least legal/build complexity:

1. **Layer 1: Behavioral Dynamics** — Big Five via IPIP (public domain, scientifically validated, ready to use)
2. **Layer 3: Risk & Decision Architecture** — Custom-built (no existing competitor does this well, strong differentiator)
3. **Layer 7: Self-Perception Gap** — Custom-built (viral mechanic via peer surveys, unique in market)

Add Layers 4 (Execution) and 6 (Career Alignment) in phase 2.
