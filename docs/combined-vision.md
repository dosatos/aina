# Self-Evaluation & Insight Platform — Combined Vision Reference

A comprehensive reference synthesizing ideas from three independent brainstorm sessions.

---

## 1. Core Vision & Positioning

### The Problem
Personality tests and self-assessments are everywhere, but they exist in silos. Taking a DISC test and then a Gallup StrengthsFinder gives you two separate PDFs that don't talk to each other. Most results are either shallow clickbait or overly corporate and cold.

### The Opportunity
A platform that **synthesizes** multiple evaluations into a holistic, evolving profile — a "User Manual for Your Life." The value isn't in any single test; it's in how the tests **intersect**.

**Example:** *"Your 'D' in DISC combined with your 'Risk-Taker' profile suggests you're a high-velocity founder type, but your Gallup results show low 'Consistency' — watch out for burnout."*

### Three Ways to Frame the Product Identity

| Identity | Focus | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| **A) Personality Platform** | Identity, behavior, natural style (like DISC, 16Personalities, Gallup) | Accessible, self-discovery |
| **B) Performance & Decision Intelligence** | Risk profile, cognitive biases, decision quality, stress response, leadership maturity, execution ability | Professional, analytical — "weaponized self-awareness" |
| **C) Growth OS** | Diagnoses + tracks change over time + suggests improvement roadmap + integrates peer feedback + combines behavioral/performance/psychological metrics | Long-term, sticky, differentiated |

**Growth OS** is the most ambitious and differentiated — it subsumes the other two. But it also has the longest path to MVP.

## 2. Target Audiences

### All Identified Segments

| Segment | Pain Points | Value Proposition | Monetization | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Career Pivoters (25-40)** | Feel stuck or misaligned mid-career; career confusion | Career path clarity, confidence, development roadmap | $19-49 one-time or $10-15/mo subscription; B2B sales to HR/coaching | gem-1, opai-1, ant-1 |
| **Founders & Entrepreneurs** | Decision fatigue, overconfidence, blind spots, poor co-founder fit | Risk profile, leadership style analysis, co-founder compatibility | $99-299 premium reports | opai-1, ant-1 |
| **High-Performance Teams (B2B)** | Managers want to understand how team members fit together | Reduce friction, increase output without hiring consultants | Per-seat pricing | gem-1 |
| **Engineering / Tech Professionals** | Technical strength =/= leadership ability; over-index on logic, under-index on EQ | "System Design for Yourself" — unique angle for a tech-savvy founder | Premium B2C or B2B | opai-1 |
| **Self-Actualizers / Life Hackers** | Love data, want to optimize routines and interactions | Personal optimization dashboard | Subscription | gem-1 |
| **Students & Early Career (18-25)** | Figuring out majors, career paths; imposter syndrome | Career alignment, strength identification | High volume, low price; institutional sales (universities, career centers) | opai-1, ant-1 |
| **Hiring / Recruiting (B2B)** | Resume =/= performance; hard to assess decision quality; cultural mismatch | Structured evaluation tests, bias detection, risk scoring, leadership index | $50-150 per candidate assessment | opai-1 |

### Recommended Starting Point
Career-oriented professionals (25-40) as the primary audience, with founder/entrepreneur elements baked in. This gives a clear value proposition ("make better career decisions by understanding yourself") and opens both B2C and B2B revenue paths. Expand to other segments later.

## 3. Assessment Layers

> **Why original layers?** Rather than referencing trademarked assessment frameworks (e.g., CliftonStrengths, DiSC, MBTI) as our layer names, we use 7 original assessment layers built entirely on public domain research. This keeps us copyright/trademark-safe and gives us full ownership of our framework. See `docs/overlap-and-generic-layers.md` for the full analysis of trademarked vs. public domain foundations.

---

### Layer 1: Behavioral Dynamics

**What it is:** How you naturally behave in social and professional settings.

**What it solves:** *"How do I show up — and why do people experience me the way they do?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Assertiveness spectrum (directive ↔ accommodating), pace preference (fast/action-oriented ↔ deliberate/reflective), people orientation (task-focused ↔ relationship-focused), structure preference (spontaneous ↔ systematic)
- **Research foundation:** Big Five (OCEAN) via IPIP public domain items + DISC behavioral theory (Marston, 1928). Both fully public domain.

**Example output:** "You lead with directness and speed. In teams, you push for decisions quickly but may skip consensus-building — which creates friction with deliberate collaborators."

---

### Layer 2: Drive & Motivation Profile

**What it is:** What actually fuels you — and what drains your energy.

**What it solves:** *"What motivates me at a deep level, and why do some roles energize me while others exhaust me?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Core motivators (autonomy, mastery, impact, security, status, connection), fear patterns (what you avoid and why), energy sources vs. energy drains, intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation balance
- **Research foundation:** Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan — academic, not proprietary), Enneagram motivation/fear framework (public domain), general values research.

**Example output:** "You're driven by autonomy and mastery but undervalue security. You energize in creative problem-solving and drain in repetitive process work. Your fear pattern: avoiding dependence on others, which can become isolation."

---

### Layer 3: Risk & Decision Architecture

**What it is:** How you make decisions under uncertainty — and where your blind spots live.

**What it solves:** *"How do I actually make decisions — and where am I systematically wrong?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Risk tolerance across domains (financial, career, social, reputational, intellectual), cognitive bias susceptibility (confirmation bias, sunk cost, overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, authority bias), decision style (analytical, intuitive, dependent, avoidant), speed-accuracy tradeoff preference
- **Research foundation:** Kahneman & Tversky's prospect theory and cognitive bias research (academic, public domain), general decision science literature.

**Example output:** "You're risk-tolerant in career moves but risk-averse financially. You over-index on intuition and under-verify with data. Your biggest blind spot: sunk cost — you hold onto failing projects 40% longer than your risk profile predicts."

---

### Layer 4: Execution & Consistency Engine

**What it is:** Your ability to follow through — the gap between intention and results.

**What it solves:** *"Why do I start things but not finish them?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Follow-through rate (start-to-finish ratio), consistency under pressure vs. comfort, long-term planning ability vs. reactive mode, setback response (bounce-back speed, adaptation vs. abandonment), energy and focus management patterns
- **Research foundation:** Conscientiousness dimension from Big Five (IPIP, public domain), grit research (Duckworth — concept is academic), self-regulation research.

**Example output:** "Your initiation energy is in the top 20%, but your follow-through drops significantly after week 3. Under pressure, you switch to reactive mode rather than sticking to plans. Your setback pattern: you reframe and restart rather than push through — innovative but expensive."

---

### Layer 5: Relational & Conflict Style

**What it is:** How you handle people, feedback, and disagreement.

**What it solves:** *"Why do my relationships and team dynamics play out the way they do?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Conflict approach (5-mode: compete, collaborate, compromise, avoid, accommodate), feedback tolerance (how well you receive criticism), empathy and emotional read accuracy, self-regulation under social stress, power orientation (seek control, share power, defer)
- **Research foundation:** Blake & Mouton conflict grid (1964, public domain), Agreeableness + Neuroticism from Big Five (IPIP), general emotional intelligence research.

**Example output:** "You default to competing in conflict, switching to avoidance when stakes feel personal. You're accurate at reading others' emotions but slow to regulate your own under stress. You seek shared power in theory but centralize decisions under pressure."

---

### Layer 6: Career & Interest Alignment

**What it is:** Whether your current path matches who you actually are.

**What it solves:** *"Am I in the right field — and what environment actually fits me?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Interest profile across 6 domains (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), work environment fit (structured ↔ ambiguous, solo ↔ team, stable ↔ dynamic), values-career alignment score, burnout risk indicators
- **Research foundation:** Holland Codes / RIASEC (public domain, O*NET-backed), general career development research, burnout research (Maslach — concept is academic).

**Example output:** "Your strongest interests are Investigative + Enterprising — you want to solve hard problems AND build something with them. Your current environment is highly Conventional, which explains the misalignment you feel. Burnout risk: moderate-high due to values mismatch, not workload."

---

### Layer 7: Self-Perception Gap (The Blindspot Layer)

**What it is:** The delta between how you see yourself and how others experience you.

**What it solves:** *"Do I see myself the way others see me — and where are my biggest blind spots?"*

**How it works:**
- **Dimensions evaluated:** Self-rated scores on Layers 1-6 vs. peer-rated scores (via a short survey sent to 3-5 people), gap analysis (where self-perception diverges from external perception), overestimation zones (you think you're better than others see you), underestimation zones (others see strengths you don't claim)
- **Research foundation:** Johari Window model (Luft & Ingham, 1955 — public domain), 360-degree feedback methodology (general HR practice, not proprietary).

**Example output:** "You rate yourself low on empathy, but your peers rate you in the top quartile — you're undervaluing a real strength. Conversely, you rate your consistency high, but peers see you as unpredictable. Biggest gap: you think you collaborate; others experience you as competing."

## 4. Cross-Layer Synthesis

The real product value isn't in any single layer — it's in the **cross-layer patterns**. This is what no existing platform does: connecting insights across dimensions to surface non-obvious truths about the user.

| Pattern | Layers Involved | Insight |
|---|---|---|
| High drive + low execution | Layer 2 + Layer 4 | "You start ambitiously but abandon mid-way. Your motivation is real; your systems aren't." |
| Risk-tolerant + avoids conflict | Layer 3 + Layer 5 | "You'll bet your career on a startup but won't push back in a meeting. Your risk is selective." |
| Career misalignment + high burnout risk | Layer 6 + Layer 4 | "The drain isn't the workload — it's the environment mismatch." |
| Self-perception gap + low feedback tolerance | Layer 7 + Layer 5 | "You have blind spots AND you resist the feedback that would reveal them." |
| High assertiveness + low empathy read | Layer 1 + Layer 5 | "You push hard but miss signals. People comply but don't buy in." |

Cross-layer synthesis is powered by the AI insight engine and is the primary differentiator of the platform.

## 5. Key Differentiating Features

### 5.1 Unified Profile / "The Synthesis"
Instead of isolated test results, the platform synthesizes *across* assessments into a multi-dimensional profile.

**Instead of:** "You are Type D."
**We give:** "You are high-dominance + high-risk + medium execution + low emotional patience. Because your risk appetite is high but your execution consistency is low, you tend to start ambitious projects but abandon them mid-way."

### 5.2 The "Blindspot Check"
A feature where users send a 2-minute survey to 3 friends/colleagues. The AI compares *how you see yourself* vs. *how the world sees you*. This has strong viral potential (invites other users into the platform).

### 5.3 Actionable Sprints
Don't just give data — give a 7-day behavioral challenge based on results.

*Example:* "Based on your high Risk-Aversion, your task today is to make one decision without asking for a second opinion."

### 5.4 AI Coach Integration
A chat interface for scenario-based advice grounded in the user's profile.

*Example:* "I have a tough meeting with a high-Dominance personality tomorrow; how should I prep based on my profile?"

### 5.5 Contextual Analysis, Not Just Labels
Output addresses real scenarios rather than abstract types: "In team settings, you likely... When under stress, watch out for... In negotiations, your natural tendency is..."

### 5.6 Growth Over Time
Retake assessments every 6 months and track evolution: emotional stability shift, risk tolerance change, confidence calibration. This also drives retention (users come back to see progress).

### 5.7 AI-Generated Narrative Reports
Instead of static PDFs: personalized narrative, real-life scenario simulations, career alignment suggestions, "you underperform in X environment" insights. An LLM generates personalized reports and answers follow-up questions.

### 5.8 The Living Profile
A dashboard that evolves as users take more modules — not a one-time PDF.

### 5.9 Profile MCP Server (AI Integration Layer)
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes the user's profile as structured context to external AI tools — Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and any MCP-compatible client. This turns the platform from a destination into **infrastructure**: your profile travels with you across every AI interaction.

**What it exposes:**
- Layer summaries (behavioral style, risk profile, execution patterns, etc.)
- Cross-layer synthesis patterns and key tensions
- Blindspot warnings (e.g., "user tends to overcommit — push back gently")
- Contextual profile slices via tools like `get_profile_context(scenario: "negotiation")`

**Why it matters:**
- Creates strong lock-in: once your AI tools "know you" through the platform, switching cost is high
- Natural upsell: free users get a basic profile MCP, premium users get full cross-layer synthesis exposed
- Aligns with Growth OS vision — the profile becomes ambient, not something you visit

## 7. Competitive Landscape

### Known Players
- **16Personalities** — Hugely popular, MBTI-based. Fun and accessible but scientifically weak. Free.
- **Truity** — Multiple assessment types, career-focused. Solid but generic reports.
- **Crystal** — DISC-based, focused on communication and sales. B2B-leaning.
- **CliftonStrengths (Gallup)** — The gold standard for strengths. Expensive, corporate, one-dimensional (strengths only).

### The Gap
No current player offers:
- Cross-assessment synthesis into a unified profile
- Risk/cognitive bias layers alongside personality
- A living, evolving dashboard (vs. one-time PDFs)
- AI-powered contextual analysis and coaching
- Peer perception comparison (Blindspot Check)

## 8. MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Launch (Layers 1, 3, 7)

| Layer | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Layer 1: Behavioral Dynamics** | Built on Big Five via IPIP — public domain, scientifically validated, and ready to use. Gives users an immediate, recognizable "personality" anchor. |
| **Layer 3: Risk & Decision Architecture** | Custom-built, no existing competitor does this well. Strong differentiator from day one. |
| **Layer 7: Self-Perception Gap** | Custom-built with a viral mechanic (peer surveys invite others into the platform). Unique in the market. |

These 3 layers deliver cross-layer synthesis value immediately (e.g., "high risk tolerance + blind spots you can't see") while keeping build complexity and legal risk low.

### Phase 2 — Expansion (Layers 4, 6)

| Layer | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Layer 4: Execution & Consistency Engine** | Most personality platforms ignore execution entirely — adding this deepens the profile significantly. |
| **Layer 6: Career & Interest Alignment** | Directly serves the primary audience (career pivoters 25-40) and unlocks B2B use cases (hiring, team-building). |

### Phase 3 — Remaining Layers + AI Integration

- **Layers 2 (Drive & Motivation) and 5 (Relational & Conflict Style)** — added based on user demand and engagement data.
- **Profile MCP Server** — Once the profile has enough depth (5+ layers populated, synthesis engine working), expose it as an MCP server so users can integrate their profile into Claude, Gemini, and other AI workflows. See Section 5.9 for details.

## 9. Open Questions & Decisions

### Product Direction
1. **Psychological or performance-based?** Personal growth and self-discovery vs. professional optimization and decision quality.
2. **Fun & accessible or serious & analytical?** This shapes tone, assessment selection, visual design, and audience.
3. **Do we want scientific validation as a core brand pillar?** If yes, stick to Big Five, VIA, established models. If no, more freedom to create engaging custom assessments.

### Business
4. **B2C or B2B first?** B2C is simpler to launch but harder to monetize. B2B has higher revenue per customer but longer sales cycles.
5. **One-time test or ongoing system?** One-time is easier MVP; ongoing system is stickier and more differentiated.

### Technical / Product
6. **Mobile-first or web app?** Assessments are easier on desktop but engagement/retention favors mobile.
7. **How deep is the AI layer?** Just generating reports, or an interactive coach experience?
8. **What's the MVP?** If we launch in 8 weeks, which 2-3 assessments and what level of analysis do we ship?

### Naming Candidates (for reference)
- MirrorMetric, Alchemy Me, Blueprint, Synapse, MirrorMe — all from brainstorm sessions; none committed.
